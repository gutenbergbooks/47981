<p>The present work, entitled “Langley Memoir on Mechanical Flight,” as
planned by the late Secretary Samuel Pierpont Langley, follows his publications
on “Experiments in Aerodynamics” and “The Internal Work of the Wind”
printed in 1891 and 1893, respectively, as parts of Volume 27 of the Smithsonian
Contributions to Knowledge.</p>

<p>This Memoir was in preparation at the time of Mr. Langley’s death in 1906,
and Part I, recording experiments from 1887 to 1896, was written by him. Part
II, on experiments from 1897 to 1903, has been written by Mr. Charles M. Manly,
who became Mr. Langley’s Chief Assistant in June, 1898. The sources of information
for this Part were the original carefully recorded accounts of the experiments
described.</p>

<p>It is expected later to publish a third part of the present memoir, to consist
largely of the extensive technical data of tests of the working of various types of
curved surfaces, propellers, and other apparatus.</p>

<p>It is of interest here to note that experiments with the Langley type of aerodrome<a id="fnanchor_1" href="#footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a>
did not actually cease in December, 1903, when he made his last trial
with the man-carrying machine, but as recently as August 6, 1907, a French
aviator made a flight of nearly 500 feet with an aerodrome of essentially the same
design. (See Appendix.)</p>

<div class="pbinavoid">
<p>In accordance with the established custom of referring to experts in the
subject treated, all manuscripts intended for publication in the Smithsonian
Contributions to Knowledge, this work was examined and recommended by a
Commission consisting of Mr. O. H. Tittman, Superintendent of the United
States Coast and Geodetic Survey, who witnessed some of the field trials, George
O. Squier, Ph. D. (Johns Hopkins), Major, Signal Corps, U. S. Army, and Albert

<h2 id="preface" title="Preface">
<a class="linkhd" href="#tocontents">◊</a>
<span class="h2txt">PREFACE</span></h2>

<p>The present volume on Mechanical Flight consists, as the title-page indicates,
of two parts. The first, dealing with the long and notable series of early
experiments with small models, was written almost entirely by Secretary Langley
with the assistance of Mr. E. C. Huffaker and Mr. G. L. Fowler in 1897. Such
chapters as were not complete have been finished by the writer and are easily
noted as they are written in the third person. It has been subjected only to such
revision as it would have received had Mr. Langley lived to supervise this publication,
and has therefore the highest value as an historical record. The composition
of the second part, dealing with the later experiments with the original
and also new models and the construction of the larger aerodrome, has necessarily
devolved upon me. This is in entire accordance with the plan formed by
Mr. Langley when I began to work with him in 1898, but it is to me a matter of
sincere regret that the manuscript in its final form has not had the advantage of
his criticism and suggestions. If the reader should feel that any of the descriptions
or statements in this part of the volume leave something to be desired in
fullness of detail, it is hoped that some allowance may be made for the fact that
it has been written in the scanty and scattered moments that could be snatched
from work in other lines which made heavy demands upon the writer’s time and
strength. It is believed, however, that sufficient data are given to enable any
competent engineer to understand thoroughly even the most complicated phases
of the work.</p>

<p>Persons who care only for the accomplished fact may be inclined to underrate
the interest and value of this record. But even they may be reminded that
but for such patient and unremitting devotion as is here enregistered, the now
accomplished fact of mechanical flight would still remain the wild unrealized
dream which it was for so many centuries.</p>

<p>To such men as Mr. Langley an unsuccessful experiment is not a failure but
a means of instruction, a necessary and often an invaluable stepping-stone to the
desired end. The trials of the large aerodrome in the autumn of 1903, to which
the curiosity of the public and the sensationalism of the newspapers gave a character
of finality never desired by Mr. Langley, were to him merely members of
a long series of experiments, as much so as any trial of one of the small aerodromes
or even of one of the earliest rubber-driven models. Had his health and
strength been spared, he would have gone on with his experiments undiscouraged
by these accidents in launching and undeterred by criticism and misunderstanding.</p>

<p>Moreover, it is to be borne in mind that Mr. Langley’s contribution to the
solution of the problem is not to be measured solely by what he himself accomplished,
important as that is. He began his investigations at a time when not
only the general public but even the most progressive men of science thought of
mechanical flight only as a subject for ridicule, and both by his epoch-making
investigations in aerodynamics and by his own devotion to the subject of flight
itself he helped to transform into a field of scientific inquiry what had before
been almost entirely in the possession of visionaries.</p>

<div class="pbinavoid">
<p>The original plans for this publication provided for a third part covering
the experimental data obtained in tests of curved surfaces and propellers. Owing
to the pressure of other matters on the writer, the preparation of this third
part is not yet complete and is reserved for later publication.</p>

<h3 title="Chapter I. Introductory.">CHAPTER I<br />
INTRODUCTORY</h3>

<p>I<a href="#footnote_2" class="fnanchor" id="fnanchor_2">2</a>
announced in 1891,<a id="fnanchor_3" href="#footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a>
as the result of experiments carried on by me
through previous years, that it was possible to construct machines
which would give such a velocity to inclined surfaces that bodies
indefinitely heavier than the air could be sustained upon it, and
moved through it with great velocity. In particular, it was stated
that a plane surface in the form of a parallelogram of 76.2 cm.&#160;× 12.2
cm. (30&#160;× 4.8 inches), weighing 500 grammes (1.1 lbs.), could be driven
through the air with a velocity of 20 metres (65.6 feet) per second
in absolutely <em class="italic">horizontal</em> flight, with an
expenditure of 1&#47;200 horse-power, or, in other terms, that 1
horse-power would propel and sustain in horizontal flight, at such a
velocity (that is, about 40 miles an hour), a little over 200 pounds
weight of such surface, where the specific gravity of the plane was
a matter of secondary importance, the support being derived from the
elasticity and inertia of the air upon which the body is made to run
rapidly.</p>

<p>It was further specifically remarked that it was not asserted that planes of
any kind were the best forms to be used in mechanical flight, nor was it asserted,
without restrictions, that mechanical flight was absolutely possible, since this
depended upon our ability to get <em class="italic">horizontal</em> flight during transport, and to leave
the earth and to return to it in safety. Our ability actually to do this, it was
added, would result from the practice of some unexplored art or science which
might be termed Aerodromics, but on which I was not then prepared to enter.</p>

<p>I had at that time, however, made certain preliminary experiments with
flying models, which have been continued up to the present year,<a id="fnanchor_4" href="#footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> and at the
same time I have continued experiments distinct from these, with the small
whirling-table established at Washington. The results obtained from the latter
being supplemental to those published in “Experiments in Aerodynamics,” and <span class="xxpn" id="p002">[p002]</span>
being more or less imperfect, were at first intended not for publication, but for
my own information on matters where even an incomplete knowledge was better
than the absence of any.</p>

<p>It is to be remembered that the mechanical difficulties of artificial flight
have been so great that, so far as is known, never at any time in the history
of the world previous to my experiment of May, 1896, had any such mechanism,
however actuated, sustained itself in the air for more than a few seconds—never,
for instance, a single half-minute—and those models which had sustained
themselves for these few seconds, had been in almost every case actuated by
rubber springs, and had been of such a size that they should hardly be described
as more than toys. This refers to actual flights in free air, unguided by any
track or arm, for, since the most economical flight must always be a horizontal
one in a straight line,<a id="fnanchor_5" href="#footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> the fact that a machine has lifted itself while pressed upward
against an overhead track which compels the aerodrome to move horizontally
and at the proper angle for equilibrium, is no proof at all of real “flight.”</p>

<p>I desire to ask the reader’s consideration of the fact that even ten years
ago,<a id="fnanchor_6" href="#footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> the whole subject of mechanical flight was so far from having attracted
the general attention of physicists or engineers, that it was generally considered
to be a field fitted rather for the pursuits of the charlatan than for those of the man
of science. Consequently, he who was bold enough to enter it, found almost none
of those experimental data which are ready to hand in every recognized and
reputable field of scientific labor. Let me reiterate the statement, which even
now seems strange, that such disrepute attached so lately to the attempt to
make a “flying-machine,” that hardly any scientific men of position had made
even preliminary investigations, and that almost every experiment to be made
was made for the first time. To cover so vast a field as that which aerodromics
is now seen to open, no lifetime would have sufficed. The preliminary experiments
on the primary question of equilibrium and the intimately associated
problems of the resistance of the sustaining surfaces, the power of the engines,
the method of their application, the framing of the hull structure which held
these, the construction of the propellers, the putting of the whole in initial
motion, were all to be made, and could not be conducted with the exactness which
would render them final models of accuracy.</p>

<p>I beg the reader, therefore, to recall as he reads, that everything here has
been done with a view to putting a trial aerodrome successfully in flight within
a few years, and thus giving an early demonstration of the only kind which is
conclusive in the eyes of the scientific man, as well as of the general public—a
demonstration that mechanical flight is possible-—by actually flying.</p>

<p>All that has been done, has been with an eye principally to this immediate
<span class="xxpn" id="p003">[p003]</span>
result, and all the experiments given in this book are to be considered only as
approximations to exact truth. All were made with a view, not to some remote
future, but to an arrival within the compass of a few years at some result in
actual flight that could not be gainsaid or mistaken.</p>

<p>Although many experimenters have addressed themselves to the problem
within the last few years—and these have included men of education and skill—the
general failure to arrive at any actual flight has seemed to throw a doubt
over the conclusions which I had announced as theoretically possible.</p>

<p>When, therefore, I was able to state that on May 6, 1896, such a degree of
success had been attained that an aerodrome, built chiefly of steel, and driven
by a steam engine, had indeed flown for over half a mile—that this machine had
alighted with safety, and had performed a second flight on the same day, it was
felt that an advance had been made, so great as to constitute the long desired
experimental demonstration of the possibility of mechanical flight. These results
were communicated to the French Academy in the note given below.<a id="fnanchor_7" href="#footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></p>

<p>Independently of the preliminary experiments in aerodynamics already published,
I had been engaged for seven years in the development of flying models.
Although the work was discouraging and often resulted in failure, success was
finally reached under the conditions just referred to, which obviously admitted
of its being reached again, and on a larger scale, if desired.
<span class="xxpn" id="p004">[p004]</span></p>

<p>In view of the great importance of these experiments, as demonstrating
beyond question the practicability of the art of mechanical flight, and also in
view of the yet inchoate state of this art, I have thought it worth while to publish
an account of them somewhat in detail, even though they involve an account
of failures; since it is from them, that those to whom it may fall to continue
such constructions, will learn what to avoid, as well as the <em class="italic">raison d’etre</em> of the
construction of the machines which have actually flown.</p>

<p>In an established art or science, this description of the essays and failures
which preceded full knowledge would have chiefly an historical interest. Here
almost nothing is yet established beyond the fact that mechanical flight has
actually been attained. The history of failure is in this case, then, if I do not
mistake, most necessary to an understanding of the road to future success, to
which it led, and this has been my motive in presenting what I have next to say
so largely in narrative form.</p>

<h3 title="Chapter II. Preliminary.">CHAPTER II<br />
PRELIMINARY</h3></div>

<p>Part I of the present work is intended to include an account of the experiments
with actual flying models, made chiefly at or near Washington, from the
earliest with rubber motors up to the construction of the steam aerodromes that
performed the flights of May 6 and November 28, 1896.</p>

<p>An account of some observations conducted at Washington, with the whirling
table, on the reaction of various surfaces upon the air, is relegated to a later
part.</p>

<p>The experiments with working models, which led to the successful flights,
were commenced in 1887, and it has seemed to me preferable to put them at first
in chronological order, and to present to the reader what may seem instructive
in their history, while not withholding from him the mistaken efforts which were
necessarily made before the better path was found. In this same connection,
I may say that I have no professional acquaintance with steam engineering, as
will, indeed, be apparent from the present record, but it may be observed that
none of the counsel which I obtained from those possessing more knowledge
was useful in meeting the special problems which presented themselves to me,
and which were solved, as far as they have been solved, by constant “trial and
error.”</p>

<p>I shall, then, as far as practicable, follow the order of dates in presenting
the work that has been done, but the reader will observe that after the preliminary
investigations and since the close of 1893, at least four or five independent
investigations, attended with constant experiment and radically distinct kinds of
construction, have been going on simultaneously. We have, for instance, the
work in the shop, which is of two essentially different kinds: first, that on the
frames and engines, which finally led to the construction of an engine of unprecedented
lightness; second, the experimental construction of the supporting
and guiding surfaces, which has involved an entirely different set of considerations,
concerned with equilibrium and support in flight. These constructions,
however successful, are confined to the shop and are, as will be seen later, useless
without a launching apparatus. The construction of a suitable launching
apparatus itself involved difficulties which took years to overcome. And, finally,
the whole had to be tested by actual flights in free air, which were conducted at
a place some 30 miles distant from the shop where the original construction
went on. <span class="xxpn" id="p006">[p006]</span></p>

<p>Simultaneously with these, original experiments with the whirling-table were
being conducted along lines of research, which though necessary have only been
indicated. We have, then, at least five subjects, so distinct that they can only
be properly treated separately, and accordingly they will be found in Chapters
VII, VIII, IX and X, <a href="#tocontents">◊</a> and in Part Third [in preparation].</p>

<p>It is inevitable that in so complex a study some repetition should present
itself, especially in the narrative form chosen as the best method of presenting
the subject to the reader. Each of these chapters, then, will contain its own
historical account of its own theme, so that each subject can be pursued continuously
in the order of its actual development, while, since they were all interdependent
and were actually going on simultaneously, the order of dates which is
followed in each chapter will be a simple and sufficient method of reference from
one to the other.</p>

<p>In order to understand how the need arises for such experiments in fixing
conditions which it might appear were already determined in the work “Experiments
in Aerodynamics,”<a id="fnanchor_8" href="#footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> it is to be constantly borne in mind, as a consideration
of the first importance, that the latter experiments, being conducted with
the whirling-table, force the model to move in horizontal flight and at a constant
angle. Now these are ideal conditions, as they avoid such practical difficulties
as maintaining equilibrium and horizontality, and for this reason alone give
results more favorable than are to be expected in free flight.</p>

<p>Besides this, the values given in “Aerodynamics” were obtained with
rigid surfaces, and these surfaces themselves were small and therefore manageable,
while larger surfaces, such as are used in actual flight, would need to be
stiffened by guys and like means, which offer resistance to the air and still
further reduce the results obtained. It is, therefore, fairly certain, that nothing
like the lift of 200 pounds to the horse-power for a rate of 40 miles an hour,<a id="fnanchor_9" href="#footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a>
obtained under these ideal conditions with the whirling-table, will be obtained
in actual flight, at least with plane wings.</p>

<p>The data in “Aerodynamics” were, then, insufficient to determine the conditions
of free flight, not alone because the apparatus compels the planes to move
in horizontal flight, but because other ideally perfect conditions are obtained by
surfaces rigidly attached to the whirling-table so as to present an angle to the
wind of advance which is invariable during the course of the experiment, whereas
the surfaces employed in actual flight may evidently change this angle and cause <span class="xxpn" id="p007">[p007]</span>
the aerodrome to move upward or downward, and thus depart from horizontal
flight so widely as to bring prompt destruction.</p>

<p>To secure this balance, or equilibrium, we know in theory, that the center
of gravity must be brought nearly under the center of pressure, by which latter
expression we mean the resultant of all the forces which tend to sustain the
aerodrome; but this center of pressure, as may in fact be inferred from “Aerodynamics,”<a id="fnanchor_10" href="#footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a>
varies with the inclination of the surface. It varies also with the
nature of the surface itself, and for one and the same surface is constantly
shifted unless the whole be rigidly held, as it is on the whirling-table, and as it
cannot be in free flight.</p>

<p>Here, then, are conditions of the utmost importance, our knowledge of which,
as derived from ordinary aerodynamic experiments, is almost nothing. A consideration
of this led me to remark in the conclusion of “Aerodynamics”:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have not asserted, without qualification, that mechanical flight is practically
possible, since this involves questions as to the method of constructing
the mechanism, of securing its safe ascent and descent, and also of securing the
indispensable condition for the economic use of the power I have shown to be
at our disposal—the condition, I mean, of our ability to guide it in the desired
<em class="italic">horizontal</em> direction during transport—questions which, in my opinion, are only
to be answered by further experiment and which belong to the inchoate art or
science of <em class="italic">aerodromics</em> on which I do not enter.”</p></div>

<p>It is this inchoate art of aerodromics which is begun in the following experiments
with actual flying machines.</p>

<p>In all discussions of flight, especially of soaring flight, the first source to
which one naturally looks for information is birds. But here correct deductions
from even the most accurate of observations are very difficult, because the
observation cannot include all of the conditions under which the bird is doing
its work. If we could but see the wind the problem would be greatly simplified,
but as the matter stands, it may be said that much less assistance has been derived
from studious observations on bird-flight than might have been anticipated,
perhaps because it has been found thus far impossible to reproduce in the flying
machine or aerostatic model the shape and condition of wing with its flexible
and controllable connection with the body, and especially the instinctive control
of the wing to meet the requirements of flight that are varying from second to
second, and which no automatic adjustment can adequately meet.</p>

<p>At the time I commenced these experiments, almost the only flying-machine
which had really flown was a toy-like model, suggested by A. Pénaud, a young
Frenchman of singular mechanical genius, who contributed to the world many
most original and valuable papers on Aeronautics, which may be found in the
journal “L’Aeronaute.” His aeroplane is a toy in size, with a small propeller
<span class="xxpn" id="p008">[p008]</span>
whose blades are usually made of two feathers, or of stiff paper, and whose motive
power is a twisted strand of rubber. This power maintains it in the air for a
few seconds and with an ordinary capacity for flight of 50 feet or so, but it embodies
a device for automatically securing horizontal flight, which its inventor
was the first to enunciate.<a id="fnanchor_11" href="#footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></p>

<p>Although Pénaud recognized that, theoretically, two screws are necessary in
an aerial propeller, as the use of a single one tends to make the apparatus revolve
on itself, he adopted the single screw on account of the greater simplicity
of construction that it permitted. One of these little machines is shown as No.
11, Plates <a href="#plt001">1</a> and <a href="#plt002">2</a>.</p>

<p><em class="italic">AB</em> is a stem about 2.5 mm. in diameter and 50 cm. long. It is bent down at
each end, with an offset which supports the rubber and the shaft of the screw
to which it is hooked. The screw <em class="italic-padr">HH</em><sup>1</sup> is 21 cm. in diameter, and has two blades
made of stiff paper; two are preferable, among other reasons, because they can
be made so that the machine will lie flat when it strikes in its descent. About
the middle of <em class="italic">AB</em> there is a “wing” surface <em class="italic">DC</em>, 45 cm. long and 11 cm. broad,
the ends <em class="italic">C</em> and <em class="italic">D</em> being raised and a little curved. In front of the screw is the
horizontal rudder <em class="italic">GK</em> having a shape like that of the first surface, with its ends
also turned up, and <em class="italic">inclined at a small negative angle with this wing surface</em>.
Along its center is a small fin-like vertical rudder that steers the device laterally,
like the rudder of a ship.</p>

<p>The approximately, but not exactly, horizontal rudder serves to hold the
device in horizontal flight, and its operation can best be understood from the
side elevation. Let <em class="italic">CD</em> be the wing plane set nearly in the line of the stem, which
stem it is desired to maintain, in flying, at a small positive angle, α, with the
horizon, α being so chosen that the tendency upward given by it will just counteract
the action of gravity. The weight of the aeroplane, combined with the
resistance due to the reaction of the air caused by its advance would, under
these conditions, just keep it moving onward in a horizontal line, if there were
no disturbance of the conditions. There is, however, in the wing no power of
self-restoration to the horizontal if these conditions are disturbed. But such
a power resides in the rudder <em class="italic">GK</em>, which is not set parallel to the wing, but at
a negative angle (α<sup>1</sup>) with it equal to the positive angle of the wing with the horizon.
It is obvious that, in horizontal flight, the rudder, being set at this angle,
presents its edge to the wind of advance and consequently offers a minimum
resistance as long as the flight is horizontal. If, however, for any reason the
head drops down, the rear edge of the rudder is raised, and it is at once subjected
to the action of the air upon its upper surface, which has a tendency to lower the
rear of the machine and to restore horizontality. Should the head rise, the lower <span class="xxpn" id="p009">[p009]</span>
surface of the rudder is subjected to the impact of the air, the rear end is raised,
and horizontality again attained. In addition to this, Pénaud appears to have
contemplated giving the rudder-stem a certain elasticity, and in this shape it is
perhaps as effective a control as art could devise with such simple means.</p>

<p>Of the flight of his little machine, thus directed, Pénaud says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If the screw be turned on itself 240 times and the whole left free in a horizontal
position, it will first drop; then, upon attaining its speed, rise and perform
a regular flight at 7 or 8 feet from the ground for a distance of about 40 metres,
requiring about 11 seconds for its performance. Some have flown 60 metres and
have remained in the air 13 seconds.<a id="fnanchor_12" href="#footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> The rudder controls the inclination to
ascend or descend, causing oscillations in the flight. Finally the apparatus descends
gently in an oblique line, remaining itself horizontal.”</p></div>

<p>The motive power is a twisted hank of fine rubber strips, which weighs 5
grammes out of a total of 16 grammes for the whole machine, whose center of
gravity should be in advance of the center of surface <em class="italic">CD</em>, as will be demonstrated
in another place. This device attracted little notice, and I was unfamiliar with
it when I began my own first constructions at Allegheny, in 1887.</p>

<p>My own earliest models employed a light wooden frame with two propellers,
which were each driven by a strand of twisted rubber.<a id="fnanchor_13" href="#footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> In later forms, the rubber
was enclosed and the end strains taken up by the thinnest tin-plate tubes,
or better still, paper tubes strengthened by shellac.</p>

<p>Little was known to me at that time as to the proper proportions between
wing surface, weight and power; and while I at first sought to infer the relation
between wing surface and weight from that of soaring birds, where it varies
from
<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">2</span></span>
to 1 sq. ft. of wing surface to the pound, yet the ratio was successively
increased in the earlier models, until it became 4 sq. ft. to 1 pound. It may be
well to add, however, that the still later experiments with the steam-driven
models, in which the supporting surface was approximately 2 sq. ft. to the
pound, proved that the lack of ability of these early rubber-driven models to
properly sustain themselves even with 4 sq. ft. of wing surface to the pound,
was largely due to the fact that the wings themselves had not been stiff enough
to prevent their being warped by the air pressure generated by their forward
motion.</p>

<p>During the years I presently describe, these tentative constructions were <span class="xxpn" id="p010">[p010]</span>
renewed at intervals without any satisfactory result, though it became clear from
repeated failures, that the motive power at command would not suffice, even for
a few seconds’ flight for models of sufficient size to enable a real study to be made
of the conditions necessary for successful flight.</p>

<p>In these earliest experiments everything had to be learned about the relative
position of the center of gravity, and what I have called the center of pressure.
In regard to the latter term, it might at first seem that since the upward pressure
of the air is treated as concentrated at one point of the supporting surface,
as the weight is at the center of gravity, this point should be always in the same
position for the same supporting surface. This relation, however, is never constant.
How paradoxical seems the statement that, if <em class="italic">ab</em> be such a supporting
surface in the form of a plane of uniform thickness and weight, suspended at <em class="italic">c</em>
(<em class="italic">ac</em> being somewhat greater than <em class="italic-padr">cb</em>) and subjected to the pressure of a wind in
the direction of the arrow, the pressure on the lesser arm <em class="italic">cb</em> will overpower that
on the greater arm <em class="italic-padr">ac</em>! We now know, however, that this must be so, and why,
but as it was not known to the writer till determined by experiments published
later in “Experiments in Aerodynamics,” all this was worked out by trial
in the models.</p>

<div class="figc-s1">
<img src="images/figure01.jpg" width="192" height="126" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">F<span class="smmaj">IG.</span></span>
1. Diagram of suspended plane showing position of <span class="nowrap">C. P.</span></div>
</div>

<p>It was also early seen that the surface of support could be advantageously
divided into two, with one behind the other, or one over the other, and this was
often, though not always, done in the models.</p>

<p>At the very beginning another difficulty was met which has proved a constant
and ever-increasing one with larger models—the difficulty of launching
them in the air. It is frequently proposed by those unfamiliar with this difficulty,
to launch the aerodrome by placing it upon a platform car or upon the deck of
a steamer, and running the car or boat at an increasing speed until the aerodrome,
which is free to rise, is lifted by the wind of advance. But this is quite impracticable
without means to prevent premature displacement, for the large surface
and slight weight renders any model of considerable size unmanageable in the
least wind, such as is always present in the open air. It is, therefore, necessary
in any launching apparatus that the aerodrome be held rigidly until the very moment
of release, and that instant and simultaneous release from the apparatus
be made at all the sustaining points at the proper moment.
<span class="xxpn" id="p011">[p011]</span></p>

<p>There is but a very partial analogy in this case to the launching of a ship,
which is held to her ways by her great weight. Here, the “ship” is liable to rise
from her ways or be turned over laterally at any instant, unless it is securely
fastened to them in a manner to prevent its rising, but not to prevent its
advancing.</p>

<p>The experiments with rubber-driven models commenced in April, 1887, at
the Allegheny Observatory, were continued at intervals (partly there, but chiefly
in Washington) for three or four years, during which time between thirty and
forty independent models were constructed, which were so greatly altered in the
course of experiment that more nearly one hundred models were in reality tried.
The result of all this extended labor was wholly inconclusive, but as subsequent
trials of other motors (such as compressed air, carbonic-acid gas, electric batteries,
and the like) proved futile, and (before the steam engine) only the rubber
gave results, however unsatisfactory, in actual flight, from which anything could
be learned, I shall give some brief account of these experiments, which preceded
and proved the necessity of using the steam engine, or other like energetic motor,
even in experimental models.</p>

<p>An early attempt was made in April, 1887, with a model consisting of a frame
formed of two wooden pieces, each about 1 metre long and 4 centimetres wide,
made for lightness, of star-shaped section, braced with cross-pieces and carrying
two long strips of rubber, each about 1 mm. thick, 30 mm. wide, 2 metres long,
doubled, weighing 300 grammes. Each of these strips could be wound to about
300 turns, one end being made fast to the front of the frame, the other to the shaft
of a four-bladed propeller 30 cm. in diameter. The wings were made of lightest
pine frames, over which paper was stretched, and were double, one being superposed
upon the other. Each was 15 cm. wide, and 120 cm. long. The distance
between them was 12 cm. and the total surface a little more than 3600 sq. cm.
(4 square feet). In flying, the rubber was so twisted that the propellers were run
in opposite directions. The weight of the whole apparatus was not quite 1 kilogramme,
or about 1 pound to 2 feet of sustaining surface, which proved to be
entirely too great a weight for the power of support. When placed upon the
whirling-table, it showed a tendency to soar at a speed of about ten miles an
hour, but its own propellers were utterly insufficient to sustain it.</p>

<p>In this attempt, which was useful only in showing how much was to be learned
of practical conditions, the primary difficulty lay in making the model light
enough and sufficiently strong to support its power. This difficulty continued to
be fundamental through every later form; but besides this, the adjustment of the
center of gravity to the center of pressure of the wings, the disposition of the
wings themselves, the size of the propellers, the inclination and number of their
blades, and a great number of other details, presented themselves for examination. <span class="xxpn" id="p012">[p012]</span>
Even in the first model, the difficulty of launching the machine or giving it
the necessary preliminary impulse was disclosed—a difficulty which may perhaps
not appear serious to the reader, but which in fact required years of experiment
to remove.</p>

<p>By June, 1887 two other models, embodying various changes that had suggested
themselves, had been constructed. Each of these had a single propeller
(one an
<span class="nowrap"><span class="mixfract">18<span class="fract"><span
 class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">2</span></span>-inch</span></span>
propeller with eight adjustable blades, the other a 24-inch propeller
with four adjustable blades) and was sustained by two pairs of curved
wings 4 feet 7 inches long. It is, however, unnecessary to dwell further on these
details, since these models also proved altogether too heavy in relation to their
power, and neither of them ever made an actual flight.</p>

<p>At this period my time became so fully occupied with the experiments in
aerodynamics (which are not here in question) that during the next two years
little additional was done in making direct investigations in flight.</p>

<p>In June, 1889, however, new rubber-driven models were made in which the
wooden frames were replaced by tubes of light metal, which, however, were still
too heavy, and these subsequently by tubes of paper covered with shellac, which
proved to be the lightest and best material in proportion to its strength that had
been found. The twisted rubber was carried within these tubes, which were made
just strong enough to withstand the end-strain it produced. The front end of
the rubber being made fast to an extremity of the tube, the other end was attached
directly to the shaft of the propeller, which in the early models was still
supplied with four blades.</p>

<p>A detailed description of one of these early models, No. 26, shown in Plates
<a href="#plt001">1</a> and <a href="#plt004">4</a>, follows:</p>

<p>In each of the two tubes of paper, stiffened with shellac, which form a part
of the framing, is mounted a hank of twisted rubber, which connects with a propeller
at the rear. There are two pairs of wings, superposed and inclined at
an angle, the one above, the other below the frame. A light stem connected
with the frame bears a triangular Pénaud tail and rudder.</p>

<p>The aerodromes made at this time were too heavy, as well as too large, to
be easily launched by hand, and it was not until 1891 that the first one was constructed
light enough to actually fly. This first flight was obtained from the
north window of the dome of the Allegheny Observatory, on March 28, 1891, and
imperfect as it was, served to show that the proper balancing of the aerodrome
which would bring the center of gravity under the center of pressure, so as to
give a horizontal flight, had yet to be obtained.</p>

<p>From this time on until 1893, experiments continued to be made with rubber-driven
models, of which, as has been stated, nearly 40 were constructed,
some with two propellers, some with one; some with one propeller in front and
one behind; some with plane, some with curved, wings; some with single, some
with superposed, wings; some with two pairs of wings, one preceding and one
following; some with the Pénaud tail; and some with other forms. A few of these
early forms are indicated on the accompanying Plates <a href="#plt001">1</a> to
<a href="#plt004">4</a>, but it does not
seem necessary to go into the details of their construction.</p>

<p>No. 11 with which an early flight was made, closely resembles the Pénaud
model.</p>

<p>No. 13 has two propellers, one in front and one behind, with a single wing.</p>

<p>No. 14 has two propellers, nearly side by side, but one slightly in advance,
with a single wing and a flat horizontal tail.</p>

<p>No. 15 has one leading propeller and two broad wings, placed one behind
the other.</p>

<p>No. 30 has the propeller shafts at an angle, and one pair of wings.</p>

<p>No. 31 has the propeller shafts at an angle, and two pairs of wings superposed.</p>

<p>The wings in general were flat, but in some cases curved. The rubber was
usually wound to about 100 turns, and trouble continually arose from its “kinking”
and unequal unwinding, which often caused most erratic flights.</p>

<p>It is sufficient to say of these that, rude as they were, much was learned from
them about the condition of the machines in free air, which could never be learned
from the whirling-table or other constrained flight.</p>

<p>The advantages and also the dangers of curved wings as compared with
plane ones, were shown, and the general disposition which would secure an even
balance, was ascertained; but all this was done with extreme difficulty, since
the brief flights were full of anomalies, arising from the imperfect conditions of
observation. For instance, the motor power was apparently exhausted more
rapidly when the propellers were allowed to turn with the model at rest, than
when it was in motion, though in theory, in the latter case more power would
seem to be expended and a greater speed of revolution obtained in a given time.
The longest flights obtainable did not exceed 6 or 8 seconds in time, nor 80 to 100
feet in distance, and were not only so brief, but, owing to the spasmodic action
of the rubber and other causes, so irregular, that it was extremely difficult to
obtain even the imperfect results which were actually deduced from them.

<p>The following rules and symbols were adopted for determining the relative
position of points on the aerodrome, some of them during 1891, and some of
them since. All are given here for convenience of reference, though their chief
application is to the larger steam aerodromes described later. Those which immediately
follow were meant to give some of the notation of descriptive geometry
in untechnical language for the use of the workmen employed. Let <em class="italic">X</em>, <em class="italic">Y</em> and <em class="italic">Z</em>
be three lines at right angles to each other, and passing through the same point
in space, <em class="italic">O</em>, lying at any convenient distance above the floor of the work-shop.
The line <em class="italic">X</em> lies North and South; the line <em class="italic">Y</em> lies East and West, and the line <em class="italic">Z</em>
points to the zenith. Now place the aerodrome on the floor so that its principal
axis lies horizontally in the plane <em class="italic">XZ</em>, with its head pointing North, and in such
a position that a line passing through the center of the propellers shall coincide
with the line <em class="italic">Y</em>.</p>

<p>When measurements are made on or parallel to the line <em class="italic">X</em>, the point of intersection
<em class="italic">O</em> will be marked 1500 centimetres, and distances toward the South

<p>When measurements are made on or parallel to the line <em class="italic">Z</em>, the point <em class="italic">O</em> will
be considered to be marked 2500 centimetres, and distances above will be greater

<span class="xxpn" id="p015">[p015]</span></p>

<p>Lastly, when measurements are made on or parallel to the line <em class="italic">Y</em>, the point
<em class="italic">O</em> will be marked 3500 centimetres, and distances toward the East will be greater
than, and distances toward the West will be less than 3500 centimetres. Measurements
in these latter directions will be comparatively infrequent because the
center of gravity and center of pressure both lie in the plane <em class="italic">XZ</em>.</p>

<p>Remembering that the principal object of all these experiments is to be able
to predict that setting of the wings and tail with reference to the center of
gravity which will secure horizontal flight, we must understand that in the following
tables (see No. 30) the figures <em class="italic">CP</em><sub>m</sub>&#160;= 1516.5 cm. mean a prediction that
the center of pressure of the sustaining surfaces in motion (<em class="italic">CP</em><sub>m</sub>) is to be found
in a certain position 1516.5; that is, 16.5 cm. in advance of the line joining the
propeller shafts. This prediction has been made by means of previous calculation
joined with previous experimental adjustment. We know in a rough way
where the <em class="italic">CP</em> will fall on the wings when they are exposed independently if flat,
and at a certain angle, and where it will fall on the tail. From these, we can
find where the resulting <em class="italic">CP</em> of the whole sustaining surface will be.</p>

<p>It would seem that when we have obtained the center of gravity by a simple
experiment, we have only to slide the wings or tail forward and back until the
(calculated) center of pressure falls over this observed center of gravity. But
in the very act of so adjusting the wings and tail, the center of gravity is itself
altered, and the operation has to be several times repeated in order to get the
two values (the center of pressure and center of gravity) as near each other as
they are found in the above-mentioned table, our object being to predict the position
which will make the actual flight itself horizontal. How far this result has
been obtained, experiment in actual flight alone can show, and from a comparison
of the prediction with the results of observation, we endeavor to improve the
formula.</p>

<p>The difficulties of these long-continued early experiments were enhanced by
the ever-present difficulty which continued through later ones, that it was almost
impossible to build the model light enough to enable it to fly, and at the same
time strong enough to withstand the strains which flight imposed upon it. The
models were broken up by their falls after a few flights, and had to be continually
renewed, while owing to the slightness of their construction, the conditions
of observation could not be exactly repeated; and these flights themselves, as has
already been stated, were so brief in time (usually less than six seconds), so
limited in extent (usually less than twenty metres), and so wholly capricious and
erratic, owing to the nature of the rubber motor and other causes, that very
many experiments were insufficient to eliminate these causes of mal-observation.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to take the reader through many of them, but not to pass
over altogether a labor which was so great in proportion to the results, but whose
results, such as they were, were the foundation of all after knowledge, I will, as
illustrations, take from an almost unlimited mass of such material the observations
of November 20, 1891, which were conducted with Model No. 30 with a
single pair of wings, shown in Plate <a href="#plt001">1</a>, and with another one, No. 31, also shown
<span class="xxpn" id="p018">[p018]</span> in Plate <a href="#plt001">1</a>, with superposed wings, which was used for the purpose of comparison.
S. P. Langley was the observer, the place of observation the larger upper
hall of the Smithsonian building, at Washington, the time being taken by a stop-watch,
and the distance by a scale laid down upon the floor. The models were in
every case held by an assistant and launched by hand, being thrown off with a
slight initial velocity. In the case of No. 30, the preliminary calculation of the
position of the center of pressure had been made by the process already described;
the center of gravity, with reference to the horizontal plane, was determined
by simply suspending the whole by a cord.</p>

<p>The objects of these experiments, as of every other, were to find the practical
conditions of equilibrium and of horizontal flight, and to compare the calculated
with the observed positions of the center of pressure. They enable us to
make a comparison of the performances given by earlier ones with a light rubber
motor, with the relatively heavy motors used to-day, as well as a comparison
of single flat, single curved, and superposed flat wings.</p>

<p>The average time of the running down of the rubber in flight was something
like three seconds, while the average time of its running down when standing
still was but one and a half seconds. It might have been expected from theory
that it would take longer to run down when stationary, than in flight, and this
was one of the many anomalies observed, whose explanation was found later in
the inevitable defects of such apparatus.</p>

<p>The immediate inferences from the day’s work were:</p>

<p>1.  That the calculated position of the <em class="italic">CP</em> at rest, as related to the <em class="italic">CG</em>, is
trustworthy only in the case of the plane wing.</p>

<p>2.  The formula altogether failed with the curved wing, for which the <em class="italic">CP</em>
had to be carried indefinitely further backward.</p>

<p>On comparing the previous flights of November 14, with these, it seems that
with the old rubber motor of 35 grammes and 50 turns, the single wing, either
plane or curved, is altogether inferior to the double wing; while with the increased
motor power of this day, the single wing, whether plane or curved, seems
to be as good as the double wing. It also seems that the curved wing was rather
more efficient than the plane one.</p>

<p>The weight of the rubber in each tube was 72 grammes, or 0.16 pounds; mean
speed of flight in horizontal distance
<span class="mixfract">4<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">2</span></span></span>
metres (about 15 feet) per second.<a id="fnanchor_16" href="#footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></p>

<p>From experiments already referred to, there were found available 300 foot-pounds
of energy in a pound of rubber as employed, and in 0.16 of a pound, 48
foot-pounds of energy were used;
<span class="fract"><span class="fup">48</span><span class="fdn">33,000</span></span>
or 0.00145&#160;= the horse-power exerted in <span class="xxpn" id="p019">[p019]</span>
one minute, but as the power was in fact expended in
1&#47;20
of that time we have
20&#160;× 0.00145&#160;= 0.029; that is, during the brief flight, about 0.03 of a horse-power
was exerted, and this sustained a total weight of only about a pound.</p>

<p>In comparing this flight with the ideal conditions of horizontal flight in “Aerodynamics,”
it will be remembered that this model’s flight was so irregular and
so far from horizontal, that in one case it flew up and struck the lofty ceiling.
The angle with the horizon is, of course, so variable as to be practically unknown,
and therefore no direct comparison can be instituted with the data given
on page 107 of “Experiments in Aerodynamics,” but we find from these that at
the lowest speed there given of about 35 feet per second, 0.03 of a horse-power
exerted for three seconds would carry nearly one pound through a distance of
somewhat over 100 feet in horizontal flight.</p>

<p>The number of turns of the propellers multiplied by the pitch corresponds
to a flight of about 16 metres, while the mean actual flight was about 12. It is
probable, however, that there was really more slip than this part of the observation
would indicate. It was also observed that there seemed to be very little
additional compensatory gain in the steering of No. 30 for the weight of the long
rudder-tail it carried. It may be remarked that in subsequent observations the
superiority of the curved wing in lifting power was confirmed, though it was
found more liable to accident than the flatter one, tending to turn the model over
unless it was very carefully adjusted.</p>

<p>It may also be observed that these and subsequent observations show, as
might have been anticipated, that as the motor power increased, the necessary
wing surface diminished, but that it was in general an easier and more efficient
employment of power to carry a surface of four feet sustaining area to the
pound than one of three, while one of two feet to the pound was nearly the limit
that could be used with the rubber motor.<a id="fnanchor_17" href="#footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></p>

<p>It may be remarked that the flights this day, reckoned in horizontal distance,
were exceptionally short, but that the best flights at other times obtained
with these models (30 and 31) did not exceed 25 metres. Such observations were
continued in hundreds of trials, without any much more conclusive results.
<span class="xxpn" id="p020">[p020]</span></p>

<p>The final results, then, of the observations with rubber-driven models (which
were commenced as early as 1887, continued actively through the greater portion
of the year 1891 and resumed, as will be seen later, even as late as 1895),
were not such as to give information proportioned to their trouble and cost, and
it was decided to commence experiments with a steam-driven aerodrome on a
large scale.</p>

<h3 title="Chapter III. Available Motors.">CHAPTER III<br />
AVAILABLE MOTORS</h3>

<p>In the introductory chapter to “Experiments in Aerodynamics,” it was
asserted that</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“These researches have led to the result that mechanical sustentation of
heavy bodies in the air, combined with very great speeds, is not only possible,
but within the reach of mechanical means we actually possess.”</p></div>

<p>It was, however, necessary to make a proper selection in order to secure
that source of power which is best adapted to the requirements of mechanical
flight. Pénaud had used india rubber as the cheapest and at the same time the
most available motor for the toys with which he was experimenting, but when
models were constructed that were heavier than anything made prior to 1887, it
appeared, after the exhaustive trials with rubber referred to in the preceding
chapter, that something which could give longer and steadier flights must be
used as a motor, even for the preliminary trials, and the construction of the
large steam-driven model known as No. 0, and elsewhere described, was begun.
Even before the completion of this, the probability of its failure grew so strong
that experiments were commenced with other motors, which it was hoped might
be consistent with a lighter construction.</p>

<p>These experiments which commenced in the spring of 1892 and continued
for nearly a twelvemonth, were made upon the use of compressed air, carbonic-acid
gas, electricity in primary and storage batteries, and numerous other contrivances,
with the result that the steam engine was finally returned to, as being
the only one that gave any promise of immediate success in supporting a
machine which would teach the conditions of flight by actual trial, though it may
be added that the gas engine which was not tried at this time on account of
engineering difficulties, was regarded from the first as being the best in theory
and likely to be ultimately resorted to. All others were fundamentally too
heavy, and weight was always the greatest enemy.</p>

<p>It is the purpose of this chapter to pass in brief review the work that was
done and the amount of energy that was obtained with these several types of
motors, as well as the obstacles which they presented to practical application
upon working aerodromes.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">I<span class="smmaj">NDIA</span></span> <span class="smcap">R<span class="smmaj">UBBER</span></span>
</h4>

<p>India rubber is the source of power to which the designer of a working
model naturally turns, where it is desirable that it shall be, above all, light and
free from the necessity of using complicated mechanism. Rubber motors were, <span class="xxpn" id="p022">[p022]</span>
therefore, used on all of the earlier models, and served as the basis of calculations
made to determine the amount of power that would be required to propel
aerodromes with other sources of energy.</p>

<p>Some of the disadvantages inherent in the use of rubber are at once apparent,
such as the limited time during which its action is available, the small total
amount of power, and the variability in the amount of power put forth in a
unit of time between the moment of release and the exhaustion of the power. In
addition, serious, though less obvious difficulties, present themselves in practice.</p>

<p>There are two ways in which rubber can be used; one by twisting a hank of
strands, and, while one end is held fast, allowing the other to revolve; the other,
by a direct longitudinal stretching of the rubber, one end being held fast and the
other attached to the moving parts of the mechanism. The former method was
adopted by Pénaud, and was also used in all of my early constructions, but while
it is most convenient and simple in its (theoretical) application, it has, in addition
to the above drawbacks, that of knotting or kinking, when wound too many
turns, in such a way as to cause friction on any containing tube not made impracticably
large, and also that of unwinding so irregularly as to make the result
of one experiment useless for comparison with another.</p>

<p>In 1895, some experiments were made in which the latter method was used,
but this was found to involve an almost impracticable weight, because of the
frame (which must be strong enough to withstand the end pull of the rubber)
and the mechanism needed to convert the pull into a movement of rotation.</p>

<p>As the power put forth in a unit of time varies, so there is a corresponding
variation according to the original tension to which the rubber is subjected.
Thus in some experiments made in 1889 with a six-bladed propeller 18.8 inches
in diameter, driven by a rubber spring 1.3 inches wide, 0.12 inch thick and 3 feet
long, doubled, and weighing 0.38 pound, the following results were obtained:</p>

<p class="continue">
Thus we see that, with twice the number of turns, more than three times the
amount of work was done and almost twice the amount of power developed, giving
as a maximum for this particular instance 328 foot-pounds per pound of
rubber.</p>

<p>The usual method of employing the twisted rubber was to use a number of
fine strands formed into a hank looped at each end. One of these hanks, consisting
of 162 single or 81 double strands of rubber, and weighing 73 grammes,
when given 51 turns developed 55 foot-pounds of work, which was put out in 4
seconds. This corresponds to 0.01 horse-power per minute for one pound of
rubber. <span class="xxpn" id="p023">[p023]</span></p>

<p>The results of a large number of tests show that one pound of twisted rubber
can put forth from 450 to 500 or more foot-pounds of work, but at the cost
of an overstrain, and that a safe working factor can hardly be taken at higher
than 300 foot-pounds, if we are to avoid the “fatigue” of the rubber, which
otherwise becomes as marked as that of a human muscle.</p>

<p>While twisting is an exceedingly convenient form of application of the resilience
of rubber to the turning of propelling wheels, the direct stretch is, as
has been remarked, much more efficient in foot-pounds of energy developed by
the same weight of rubber. It was found that rubber could not, without undue
“fatigue,” be stretched to more than four and a half times its original length,
though experiments were made to determine the amount of work that a rubber
band, weighing one pound, was capable of doing, the stretching being carried
to seven times its original length. The results varied with the rubber used and
the conditions of temperature under which the experiments were tried, ranging
from 1543 foot-pounds to 2600 foot-pounds. The tests led to the conclusion that,
for average working, one pound of rubber so stretched, is capable of doing 2000
foot-pounds of work, but, owing to the weight of the supporting frame and of
the mechanism, this result can be obtained only under conditions impracticable
for a flying machine. In the more practicable twisted form it furnishes, as has
been said, less than a fifth of that amount.</p>

<p>The conclusions reached from these experiments are:</p>

<p>1. The length of the unstretched rubber remaining the same, the sustaining
power will be directly proportional to the weight of rubber;</p>

<p>2. With a given weight of rubber, the end strain is inversely proportional
to the length of the unstretched rubber;</p>

<p>3. With a given weight of rubber, the work done is constant, whatever the
form; hence if we let <em class="italic">w</em>&#160;= the work in foot-pounds,
<em class="italic">g</em>&#160;= the weight of the rubber
in pounds, and <em class="italic">k</em>&#160;= a constant taken at 2000 as given above, we have</p>

<div class="equationbox">
<em class="italic">w</em>&#160;= <em class="italic">kg</em>&#160;= 2000
<em class="italic-padr">g</em> foot-pounds.
</div>

<p class="continue">This is for an extension of seven units of length, so that for a unit of extension
we would have approximately</p>

<div class="equationbox">
<em class="italic">w</em>&#160;= 300 <em class="italic-padr">g</em>
foot-pounds</div>

<p class="continue">which for four units of extension corresponds very closely to the 1300 foot-pounds
which Pénaud claims to have obtained.</p>

<p>4. The end strain varies with the cross-section for a given unit of extension.</p>

<p>These results can lead to but one conclusion; that for the development of the
same amount of power when that amount shall be 1 horse-power or more, rubber
weighs enormously more than a steam engine, besides being less reliable <span class="xxpn" id="p024">[p024]</span>
for a sustained effort, and, therefore, cannot be used for propelling aerodromes
intended for a flight that is to be prolonged beyond a few seconds.<a id="fnanchor_18" href="#footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></p>

<p>It may be desirable to present a tabular view of the <em class="italic">theoretical</em> energy of
available motors, which it will be noticed is a wholly different thing from the
results obtained in practice. Thus, we represent the weight of rubber only, without
regard to the weight of the frame required to hold it. In the steam engine,
we consider the theoretical efficiency per pound of fuel, without regarding the
enormous waste of weight in water in such small engines as these, or the weight
of the engine itself. We treat the hot-water engine in like manner, and in regard
to carbonic acid and compressed air, we take no note of the weight of the
containing vessel, or of the cylinders and moving parts. In the same way we
have the theoretical potency of electricity in primary and storage batteries,
without counting the weight of the necessary electromotors; and of the inertia-engine
without discussing that of the mechanism needed to transmit its power.</p>

<p>It may be interesting to consider next, in even a roughly approximate way,
what may be expected from these various sources of energy in practice.</p>

<h4>
<span class="smcap">S<span class="smmaj">TEAM</span></span> <span class="smcap">E<span class="smmaj">NGINE</span></span>
</h4>

<p>The steam engine on a small scale, and under the actual restrictions of the
model, must necessarily be extremely wasteful of power. If we suppose it to
realize 2 per cent of the theoretical energy contained in the fuel, we shall be assuming
more than was actually obtained. The energy of the fuel cannot be
obtained at all, of course, without boiler and engine, whose weight, for the purpose
of the following calculation, must be added to that of the fuel; and if we
suppose the weight of the boilers, engines and water, for a single minute’s flight,
to be collectively ten pounds, we shall take an optimistic view of what may be
expected under ordinary conditions. We have in this view
<span class="nowrap">1&#47;500</span>
of the <span class="xxpn" id="p025">[p025]</span> theoretical
capacity possibly realizable under such conditions, but if we take
<span class="nowrap">1&#47;1000</span>
we shall probably be nearer the mark. Even in this case we have, when using
gasoline as fuel, 15,625 foot-pounds per minute, or nearly 0.50 horse-power, as
against .0091 horse-power in the case of the rubber, so that even with this waste
and with the weight of the engines necessary for a single minute’s service, the
unit weight of fuel employed in the steam engine gives 55 times the result we
get with rubber.</p>

<p>With alcohol we have about
<span class="fract"><span class="fup">2</span><span class="fdn">3</span></span>
the result that is furnished by gasoline, since
nearly the same boiler and engine will be used in either case. Certain difficulties
which at first appeared to be attendant on the use of gasoline on a small scale
induced me to make the initial experiments with alcohol. This was continued
because of its convenience during a considerable time, but it was finally displaced
in favor of gasoline, not so much on account of the superior theoretical efficiency
of the latter, as for certain practical advantages, such as its maintaining its flame
while exposed to wind, and like considerations.</p>

<p>Although there are other explosives possessing a much greater energy in
proportion to their weight than gunpowder, this is the only one which could be
considered in relation to the present work, and the conclusion was finally reached
that it involved so great a weight in the containing apparatus and so much experiment,
that, although the simplicity of its action is in its favor where crude
means are necessary, experiments with it had better be deferred until other
things had been tried.</p>

<span class="smcap">E<span class="smmaj">NGINE</span></span></h4>

<p>A great deal of attention was given to the hot-water engine, but it was
never put to practical use in the construction of an aerodrome, partly on account
of the necessary weight of a sufficiently strong containing vessel.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">C<span class="smmaj">OMPRESSED</span></span>
<span class="smcap">A<span class="smmaj">IR</span></span></h4>

<p>Compressed air, like the other possible sources of power, was investigated,
but calculations from well-authenticated data showed that this system of propelling
engines would probably be inadequate to sustain even the models in long
flights. As the chief difficulty lies in the weight, not of the air, but of the containing
vessel, numerous experiments were made in the construction of one at
once strong and light. The best result obtained was with a steel tube 40 mm.
in diameter, 428 mm. in length, closed at the ends by heads united by wires,
which safely contained 538 cubic cm. of air at an initial pressure of 100 atmospheres
for a weight of 521 grammes. <span class="xxpn" id="p026">[p026]</span></p>

<p>If we suppose this to be used, by means of a proper reducing valve, at a
mean pressure of 100 pounds, for such an engine as that of Aerodrome No. 5,
which takes 60 cubic cm. of air at each stroke, we find that (if we take no account
of the loss by expansion) we have 18,329 foot-pounds of energy available, which
on the engine described will give 302 revolutions of the propellers.</p>

<p>There are such limits of weight, and the engines must be driven at such high
speeds, that the increased economy that might be obtained by re-heating the
air would be out of the question. The principal object in using it would have
been the avoidance of fire upon the aerodrome, and the expansion of the unheated
air would probably have caused trouble with freezing, while the use of hot (i. e.
superheated) water was impracticable. So when, after a careful computation, it
was found that, having regard to the weight of the containing vessel, only enough
compressed air could be stored at 72 atmospheres and used at 4, to run a pair
of engines with cylinders 0.9 inch in diameter by 1.6 inches stroke, at a speed of
1200 revolutions per minute for 20 seconds, all further consideration of its adaptation
to the immediate purpose was definitely abandoned. This course, however,
was not taken until after a model aerodrome for using compressed air had
been designed and partially built. Then, after due consideration, it was decided
to make the test with carbonic-acid gas instead.</p>

<h4>
<span class="smcap">G<span class="smmaj">AS</span></span>
</h4>

<p>The gas engine possesses great theoretical advantages. At the time of these
experiments, the gas engine most available for the special purposes of the models
was one driven by air drawn through gasoline. As the builders could not agree
to reduce the weight of a one horse-power engine more than one-half of the then
usual model, and as the weight of the standard engine was 470 pounds, it was
obvious that to reduce this weight to the limit of less than 3 pounds was impracticable
under the existing conditions, and all consideration of the use of gas
was abandoned provisionally, although a gasoline engine of elementary simplicity
was designed but never built. I purposed, however, to return to this attractive
form of power if I were ever able to realize its theoretical advantages
on the larger scale which would be desirable.</p>

<h4>
<span class="smcap">E<span class="smmaj">LECTRICITY</span></span>
</h4>

<p>As it was not intended to build the model aerodromes for a long flight, it
was thought that the electric motor driven by a primary or storage battery might
possibly be utilized. It therefore occurred to me that a battery might be constructed
to give great power in proportion to its weight on condition of being
short-lived, and that in this form a battery might perhaps advantageously take
the place of the dangerous compressed-air tubes that were at the time (1893) <span class="xxpn" id="p027">[p027]</span>
under consideration for driving the models. I assumed that the longest flight of
the model would be less than five minutes. Any weight of battery, then, that the
model carried in consumable parts lasting beyond this five minutes would be
lost, and hence it was proposed to build a battery, the whole active life of which
would be comprised in this time, to actuate a motor or motors driving one or
two propellers.</p>

<p>According to Daniell, when energy is stored in secondary batteries, over
300,000 megergs per kilogramme of weight can be recovered and utilized if
freshly charged.</p>

<div class="equationbox">
<div>300,000 megergs&#160;= 0.696 horse-power for 1 min.</div>
<div>300,000 megergs&#160;= 0.139 horse-power for 5 min.</div>
</div>

<p>In a zinc and copper primary battery with sulphuric acid and water, one
kilogramme of zinc, oxidized, furnishes at least 1200 calories as against 8000
for one kilogramme of carbon, but it is stated that the zinc energy comes in so
much more utilizable a form that the zinc, weight for weight, gives practically,
that is in work, 40 per cent that of carbon. The kilogramme of carbon gives
about 8000 heat units, each equal to 107 kilogrammetres, or about 6,176,000 foot-pounds.
Of this, in light engines, from 5 to 10 per cent, or at least 308,800
foot-pounds, is utilized, and
<span class="fract"><span class="fup">2</span><span class="fdn">5</span></span>
of this, or about 124,000 foot-pounds, would seem
to be what the kilogramme of zinc would give in actual work. But to form the
battery, we must have a larger weight of fluid than of zinc, and something must
be allowed for copper. If we suppose these to bring the weight up to 1 kilogramme,
we might still hope to have 50,000 foot-pounds or 1.5 horse-power for
one minute, or 0.3 horse-power for 5 minutes.</p>

<p>Storage batteries were offered with a capacity of .25 horse-power for 5 minutes
per kilogramme, but according to Daniell one cannot expect to get more
than 0.139 horse-power from a freshly charged battery of that weight for the
same time.</p>

<p>The plan of constructing a battery of a long roll of extremely thin zinc or
magnesium, winding it up with a narrower roll of copper or platinized silver, insulating
the two metals and then pouring over enough acid to consume the major
portion of the zinc in 5 minutes, was carefully considered, but the difficulties were
so discouraging, that the work was not undertaken.</p>

<p>The lightest motors of 1 horse-power capacity of which any trace could be
found weighed 25 pounds, and a prominent electrician stated that he would not
attempt to construct one of that weight.</p>

<p>In trials with a
<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">2</span></span>
horse-power motor driving an 80 cm. propeller of 1.00
pitch-ratio, I apparently obtained a development of 0.56 indicated horse-power
at 1265 revolutions; but at lower speeds when tried with the Prony brake, the
brake horse-power fell to 0.10 at 546 revolutions, and even at 1650 revolutions <span class="xxpn" id="p028">[p028]</span>
it was but 0.262 indicated, with a brake horse-power of 0.144, or 55 per cent of
that indicated.</p>

<p>With these results both of theoretical calculation and practical experiment,
all thought of propelling the proposed aerodrome by electricity was necessarily
abandoned.</p>

<h4>
<span class="smcap">C<span class="smmaj">ARBONIC</span></span>-<span class="smcap">A<span class="smmaj">CID</span></span> <span class="smcap">G<span class="smmaj">AS</span></span>
</h4>

<p>At the first inception of the idea, it seemed that carbonic-acid gas would
be the motive power best adapted for short flights. It can be obtained in the
liquid form, is compact, gives off the gas at a uniform pressure dependent upon
the temperature, and can be used in the ordinary steam engine without any
essential modifications. The only provision that it seemed, in advance, necessary
to make, was that of some sort of a heater between the reservoir of liquid
and the engine, in order to prevent freezing, unless the liquid itself could be
heated previous to launching.</p>

<p>The engines in which it was first intended to use carbonic acid were the little
oscillating cylinder engines belonging to Aerodrome No. 1. The capacity of
each cylinder was 21.2 cu. cm., so that 84.8 cu. cm. of gas would be required to
turn the propellers one revolution when admitted for the full stroke, and 101,760
cubic cm. for 1200 revolutions. The density of the liquid at a temperature of
24° C. was taken as .72, and as 1 volume of liquid gives 180 volumes of gas at
a pressure of
<span class="mixfract">2<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">2</span></span></span>
atmospheres, we have
<span class="nowrap"><span class="fract"><span class="fup">101,760</span><span class="fdn">180</span></span>&#160;=</span>
565 cu. cm. of liquid, or 407
grammes required for 1200 revolutions of the engines.</p>

<p>Thus, a theoretical calculation seemed to indicate that a kilogramme of
liquid carbonic acid would be an ample supply for a run of two minutes. The
experiments were, at first, somewhat encouraging. The speed and apparent
power of the engines were sufficient for the purpose, but the length of time
during which power could be obtained was limited.</p>

<p>In 1892, 415 grammes of carbonic acid drove the engines of Aerodrome No.
3 700 revolutions in 60 seconds, 900 in 75, and 1000 in 85 seconds, at the end
of which time the gas was entirely expended. The diameter of these cylinders was
2.4 cm., the stroke of the pistons 7 cm., and the work done, that of driving a pair
of 50 cm. propellers, when taken in comparison with the propeller tests detailed
elsewhere, amounted to an effective horse-power of about 0.10 for the output of
the engine.</p>

<p>The difficulties, however, that were experienced were those partially foreseen.
The expansion of the gas made such serious inroads upon the latent heat
of the liquid, that lumps of solid acid were formed in the reservoir, and could be
heard rattling against the sides when the latter was shaken, while the expansion
of the exhaust caused such a lowering of temperature at that point, that the <span class="xxpn" id="p029">[p029]</span>
pipes were soon covered with a thick layer of ice, and the free exit of the escaping
gas was prevented.</p>

<p>Such difficulties are to be expected with this material, but here they were
enhanced by the small scale of the construction and the constant demand for
lightness. And it was found to be very hard to fill the small reservoirs intended
to carry the supply for the engines. When they were screwed to the large case
in which the liquid was received and the whole inverted, the small reservoir
would be filled from one-third to one-half full, and nothing that could be done
would force any more liquid to enter.</p>

<p>In view of these difficulties, and the objections to using a heater of any sort
for the gas, as well as the absolute lack of success attendant upon the experiments
of others who were attempting to use liquid CO<sub>2</sub> as a motive power on a
large scale elsewhere, experiments were at first temporarily and afterwards
permanently abandoned.</p>

<p>The above experiments extended over nearly a year in time, chiefly during
1892, and involved the construction and use of the small aerodromes Nos. 1, 2,
and 3, presently described.</p>

<h3 title="Chapter IV. Early Steam Motors and Other Models.">
CHAPTER IV<br />EARLY STEAM MOTORS AND OTHER MODELS</h3></div>

<p>In dealing with the development of the aerodrome, subsequent to the early
rubber-driven models, the very considerable work done and the failures incurred
with other types of motors than steam, have been briefly dealt with in the preceding
chapter, but are scarcely mentioned here, as no attempts at long flights
were ever successful with any other motor than steam, and no information was
gained from any of the experiments made with compressed air, gas, carbonic
acid, or electricity, that was of much value in the development of the successful
steam machines.</p>

<p>In November, 1891, after the long and unsatisfactory experiments with rubber-driven
models already referred to, and before most of the experiments with
other available motors than steam had been made, I commenced the construction
of the engines and the design of the hull of a steam-driven aerodrome, which
was intended to supplement the experiments given in “Aerodynamics” by
others made under the conditions of actual flight.</p>

<p>In designing this first aerodrome, here called No. 0, there was no precedent
or example, and except for the purely theoretical conditions ascertained by the
experiments described in “Aerodynamics,” everything was unknown. Next to
nothing was known as to the size or form, as to the requisite strength, or as to the
way of attaching the sustaining surfaces; almost nothing was known as to the
weight permissible, and nothing as to the proper scale on which to build the aerodrome,
even if the design had been obtained, while everything which related
to the actual construction of boiler and engines working under such unprecedented
conditions was yet to be determined by experiment.</p>

<p>The scale of the actual construction was adopted under the belief that it
must be large enough to carry certain automatic steering apparatus which I had
designed, and which possessed considerable weight. I decided that a flying machine
if not large enough to carry a manager, should in the absence of a human
directing intelligence, have some sort of automatic substitute for it, and be large
enough to have the means of maintaining a long and steady flight, during which
the problems (which the rubber-driven models so imperfectly answered) could
be effectually solved.</p>

<p>When, in 1891, it was decided to attempt to build this steam aerodrome, the
only engine that had been made up to that time with any claim to the lightness
and power I was seeking, was the Stringfellow engine, exhibited at the Crystal
Palace in London, in 1868, which it was then announced developed 1 horse-power <span class="xxpn" id="p031">[p031]</span>
for a total weight (boiler and engines) of 13 pounds. The original engine
came into the possession of the Institution in 1889 as an historical curiosity, but
on examination, it was at once evident that it never had developed, and never
could develop the power that had been attributed to it, and probably not one-tenth
so much.</p>

<p>With the results obtained on the whirling-table at Allegheny as a basis, a
theoretical computation of the weight which 1 horse-power would cause to soar
showed that, with a plane whose efficiency should be equal to that of a 30&#160;× 4.8
inch plane set at an angle of 5° and moving at a speed of 34 miles an hour, 1
horse-power would support 120 pounds.<a id="fnanchor_19" href="#footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> With a smaller angle even better results
could be obtained, but as the difficulties of guidance increase as the angle diminishes,
I did not venture to aim at less than this. In this computation, no
allowance was made for the fact that these results were obtained by a mechanism
which <em class="italic">forcibly maintained</em> the supporting surface in the ideal condition of the
best attainable angle of attack as if in perfect equilibrium, and above all in the
equally ideal condition of perfectly horizontal flight.</p>

<p>Besides this, I had to consider in actual flight the air resistance due to the
guy wires and hull, but after making an allowance of as much as three-quarters
for these differences between the conditions of experiment and those of free
flight, I hoped that 1 horse-power would serve to carry 30 pounds through the
air if a supporting surface as large as 3 feet to the pound could be provided,
and this was the basis of the construction which I will now describe.</p>

<p>The general form of this Aerodrome No. 0, without wings or propellers,
is shown in the accompanying photograph in Plate <a href="#plt010">10</a>. Its dimensions and its
weights, as first designed, and as finally found necessary, are as follows:</p>

<p class="continue">(The weights attained in the actual making were, as is seen, nearly double those
first estimated, and this constant increase of weight under the exigencies of construction
was a feature which could never be wholly eliminated.)
<span class="xxpn" id="p032">[p032]</span></p>

<p>After studying various forms for the hull or body of the prospective aerodrome,
I was led to adopt the lines which Nature has used in the mackerel as
most advantageous so far as the resistance of the air was concerned, but it proved
to be difficult in construction to make the lines of the bow materially different
from those of the stern, and in this first model the figure was symmetrical
throughout.</p>

<p>As I wish that my experience may be of benefit to the reader, even in its
failures, I will add that I made the not unnatural mistake of building on the plan
on which the hull of an ordinary ship is constructed; that is, making the hull
support the projecting bowsprit and other parts. In the aerodrome, what corresponds
to the bowsprit must project far in advance of the hull to sustain the
front wings, and a like piece must project behind it to sustain the rear wings and
the tail, or the supporting surfaces of whatever kind. The mistake of the construction
lay in disjoining these two and connecting them indirectly by the insufficiently
strong hull which supported them. This hull was formed of longitudinal
U-shaped ribs of thin steel, which rested on rings made of an alloy of
aluminum, which possessed the lightness of the latter metal with very considerable
toughness, but which was finally unsatisfactory. I may say parenthetically
that in none of the subsequent constructions has the lightness of aluminum been
found to compensate for its very many disadvantages.  The two rods, which were
each 1 metre in length, were with difficulty kept rigorously in line, owing to the
yielding of the constructionally weak hull. It would have been better, in fact, to
have carried the rod straight through at any inconvenience to the disposition of
the boilers and the engine.</p>

<span class="nowrap">NOS. 0, 1, 2, 3, 1891 AND 1892</span>
<a class="linka" href="#listplates">◊</a></div>
</div>

<p>I may add that the sustaining surfaces, which were to be nearly flat wings,
composed of silk stretched from a steel tube with wooden attachments, were to <span class="xxpn" id="p033">[p033]</span>
have been carried on the front rod, but, as subsequent experience has shown,
these wings would have been inadequate to the work, both from their insufficient
size and their lack of rigidity.</p>

<p>The propellers, which were to be 80 cm. in diameter, 1.25 pitch-ratio, and
which were expected to make from five to six hundred revolutions a minute, were
carried on the end of long tubular shafts, not parallel, but making with each
other an angle of 25 degrees, and united by gears near the bow of the vessel in
the manner shown in Plate <a href="#plt010">10</a>.</p>

<p>The first engines were of the oscillating type, with the piston-rod connected
directly to the crank; were very light, and were unprovided with many of the
usual fittings belonging to a steam engine, such as rod or piston packing; and
their construction was crude in comparison with their successors. They were
tested with the Prony brake and found to be deficient in power, for with a steam
pressure of 80 pounds to the square inch, they ran at the rate of 1170 revolutions
per minute, and developed only .363 horse-power. It soon became evident
that they were too light for the work that it was intended that they should do,
and steps were taken, even before the completion of these tests, for the construction
of a pair of more powerful cylinders, which should also be provided with a
special boiler for the generation of the steam. Acting upon the supposition,
in a saving of steam, it was decided to work with compounded cylinders. As two
propellers were to be used, they were each fitted with a distinct pair of cylinders
working directly upon the shaft, but so connected by gearing that they were
compelled to turn at the same rate of speed.</p>

<p>The cylinders were of the inverted oscillating type, like the first pair of
engines, but, unlike them, they were single-acting. The dimensions were: diameter
of high-pressure cylinder 1.25 inches; low pressure, 1.94 inches, with a
common stroke of 2 inches, and with cranks set opposite to each other so that
one cylinder was always at work. The cylinders were held at their upper ends
by a strap passing around a hollow conical trunk, which served the double purpose
of a support for the cylinders and an intermediate receiver between them.
This receiver had a mean inside diameter of 1.25 inches, with a length of 4.75
inches, so that it had about twice the cubical capacity of the high-pressure cylinder,
while the displacement of the low-pressure cylinder was about 2.5 times
that of the high; ratios that would have given satisfactory results, perhaps, had
the steam pressure and other conditions been favorable to the use of the compound
principle in this place. There were no valves for the admission of the
steam, for, inasmuch as the engines were single-acting, it was possible to make
ports in the cylinder-head act as the admission and exhaust ports as the cylinder
oscillated, and thus avoid the complication and weight of eccentric and valves.
<span class="xxpn" id="p034">[p034]</span></p>

<p>These cylinders were set in a light frame at an angle of 25° with each
other, or 12.5° with the median line of the aerodrome, and drove the long propeller
shafts as shown in Plate <a href="#plt010">10</a>, No. 0. At the extreme forward end of the
crank-shafts there was a pair of intermeshing bevel gears which served to maintain
the rate of revolution of the two propellers the same.</p>

3. Boilers in use in 1891–1892.</div>
</div>

<p>The boiler built for this work was a beehive-shaped arrangement of coils
of pipe. It consisted at first, as shown in Fig. 3, of three double coils of
<span class="nowrap"><span class="fract"><span class="fup">3</span><span class="fdn">8</span></span>-inch</span>
copper pipe coiled up in the shape of a truncated cone, carrying in the central
portion a pear-shaped receiver into the upper portion of which the water circulating
through the coils discharged. Each of these receivers was connected
at the top with the bottom of a long cylindrical drum, with hemispherical ends,
which formed a steam space from which supply for the engines was drawn.
The lower ends of the coils were connected with an injection pipe supplying the
water. Each “beehive” had 23 turns of tubing, and had a base of 7.5 inches
and a top diameter of 6 inches, the steam drum being 2.5 inches in diameter. I
may here say that in the selection of the general type of boiler for the work to
be done, there was never any hesitation regarding the use of the water-tube
variety. Their superiority for the quick generation of large volumes of steam
had been so pronounced that nothing else seemed capable of competing with <span class="xxpn" id="p035">[p035]</span>
them in this respect, regardless of the absolute economy of fuel that might or
might not be exhibited. Hence, to the end of my experiments nothing else was
used.</p>

<p>Even before the “beehive” boiler was completed, I was anxious to ascertain
what could be done with a coil of pipe with a stream of water circulating through
it, as well as with various forms of burners, for I realized that the success of the
apparatus depended not only upon getting an exceedingly effective heating surface,
but also an equally effective flame to do the heating.</p>

<p>For fuel I naturally turned to the liquids as being more compact and readily
regulated. Whether to use some of the more volatile hydrocarbons or alcohol,
was still an unsolved problem, but my opinion at the time was that, on the limited
scale of the model, better results could probably be obtained with alcohol.</p>

<p>In the experiments made with a coil preliminary to the trial of the “beehive”
boiler, I tried a simple horizontal coil of
<span class="nowrap"><span class="fract"><span class="fup">3</span><span class="fdn">8</span></span>-inch</span>
copper pipe into which
two forked burners working on the Bunsen principle and using city illuminating
gas, were thrust. The jets were about
<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">2</span></span>
inch apart. The arrangement primed
so badly that the engines could not get rid of the entrained water, and would only
make a few turns.</p>

<p>I then tried the same coil with two 1.25-inch drums in the inside and with
five longitudinal water tubes at the bottom, beneath which were the same two
forked burners used in the previous experiment. The coils were covered with
a sheet of asbestos, and two round burners were added. This boiler would hold
a steam pressure of about 15 pounds and run the engine slowly; but if the pressure
were allowed to rise to 60 pounds, the engine would drive a 2-foot propeller
of 18-inch pitch at the rate of about 650 turns per minute for from 80 to 90
seconds, while the steam ran down to 10 pounds, showing that this boiler, at
least, was too small. This was further shown in a trial of the plain coil made
in October, 1891; 6 pounds of water were evaporated in 32 minutes under a pressure
of 60 pounds. This was at the rate of 11.25 pounds per hour, or, taking
the U. S. Centennial standard of 30 pounds of evaporation per horse-power,
gave an available output of less than
<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">3</span></span>
horse-power.</p>

<p>With these results before me, I decided to make a trial of the “beehive”
principle upon a smaller scale than in the boiler designed for Aerodrome No. 0.
I used a small boiler of which the inner coil consisted of 8 turns of
<span class="nowrap"><span class="fract"><span class="fup">3</span><span class="fdn">8</span></span>-inch</span> copper
tube about 28 gauge thick, and the outer coil of 11 turns of

This gave 12 feet of
<span class="nowrap"><span class="fract"><span class="fup">3</span><span class="fdn">8</span></span>-inch,</span>
and 16 feet of
<span class="nowrap"><span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">4</span></span>-inch</span>
tubing. The drum was of No.
27 gauge, hard planished copper. With this boiler consuming 6 oz. of fuel, 80.3
oz. of water were evaporated in 28 minutes, or at the rate of about 10.75 pounds
per hour. As these coils contained but 2.22 square feet of heating surface, and
as the three to be built would contain 3.7 square feet each, it was estimated the <span class="xxpn" id="p036">[p036]</span>
10 square feet afforded by them could safely be depended upon to provide steam
for a 1 horse-power engine.  As far as fuel consumption was concerned, the rate
of evaporation was about 15.6 pounds of water per pound of gasoline, all of
which was satisfactory.</p>

<p>The burner originally designed for use in connection with the “beehive”
boilers, consisted of a small tank in which a quantity of gasoline was placed, the
space above being filled with compressed air. Rising from the bottom of this
tank was a small pipe coiling back and down and ending in an upturned jet from
which the gas generated in the coil would issue. The burner thus served to
generate its own gas and act as a heater for the boilers at the same time.</p>

<p>In the construction of Aerodrome No. 0, four of the “beehive” coils were
placed in a line fore and aft. The fuel tank was located immediately back of the
rear coil and consisted of a copper cylinder 11 cm. in diameter and 9 cm. long.
The engines were placed immediately in front of the coils, all the apparatus
being enclosed in a light framing, as shown in the photograph (Plate <a href="#plt010">10</a>).</p>

<p>Extending front and back from the hull were the tubes for supporting the
wings and tail, each one metre in length. The cross-framing for carrying the
propeller shafts was built of tubing 1.5 cm. diameter, and the shafts themselves
were of the same size. The ribs of the hull were rings made of angle-irons
measuring 1.50&#160;× 1.75 cm., which were held in place longitudinally by five 0.7 cm.
channel bars.</p>

<p>As it had been learned in the preliminary experiments with the model “beehive”
boiler that the heated water would not of itself cause a sufficiently rapid
circulation to be maintained through the tubes to prevent them from becoming
red-hot, two circulating pumps were added for forcing the water through the
coils of the two forward and two rear boilers respectively, the water being taken
from the lower side of the drum and delivered into the bottom of the coils, which
were united at that point for the purpose. A worm was placed upon each of the
propeller shafts, just back of the engines, meshing in with a gear on a crank-shaft
from which the pumps were driven. This shaft rotated at the rate of 1 to
24, so that for 1200 revolutions of the engine, it would make but 50, driving a
single-acting plunger 1.2 cm. in diameter and 2 cm. stroke.</p>

<p>Apparently all was going well until I began to try the apparatus. First,
there was a difficulty with the burner, which could not be made to give forth the
relative amount of heat that had been obtained from the smaller model, and
steam could not be maintained. With one “beehive” connected with the compound
engine, and a 70 cm. propeller on the shaft, there were about 250 turns
per minute for a space of about 50 seconds, in which time the steam would fall
from 90 pounds to 25 pounds, and the engine would stop. Then, as we had no
air-chamber on the pumps at the time, they would not drive the water through
the coils.  Subsequent experiments, however, showed that the boilers could be <span class="xxpn" id="p037">[p037]</span>
depended upon to supply the steam that the compound engines would require;
but after the whole was completed, the weight, if nothing else, was prohibitory.</p>

<p>I had gone on from one thing to another, adding a little here and a little
there, strengthening this part and that, until when the hull was finally completed
with the engines and boilers in place, ready for the application of the wings, the
weight of the whole was found (allowing 7 pounds for the weight of the wings
and tail) to be almost exactly 45 pounds, and nearly 52 pounds with fuel and
water. To this excessive weight would have to be added that of the propellers,
and as the wings would necessarily have to be made very large in order to carry
the machine, and as the difficulties of launching had still to be met, nothing was
attempted in the way of field trials, and with great disappointment the decision
was made in May, 1892 (wisely, as it subsequently appeared) to proceed no
further with this special apparatus.</p>

<p>However, inasmuch as this aerodrome with its engines and boilers had been
completed at considerable expense, it was decided to use the apparatus as far
as it might be practicable, in order to learn what must be done to secure a
greater amount of success in the future. The fundamental trouble was to get
<em class="italic">heat</em>. In the first place there was trouble with the burners, for it seemed to be
impossible to get one that would vaporize the gasoline in sufficient quantity to
do the work, and various forms were successively tried.</p>

<p>All of the early part of 1892 was passed in trying to get the boilers to work
at a steam pressure of 100 pounds per square inch. On account of the defects
in the tubes and elsewhere this required much patient labor. The writer, even
thus early, devised a plan of using a sort of aeolipile, which should actuate its
own blast, but this had to be abandoned on account of the fact that the pear-shaped
receivers would not stand the heat. This necessitated a number of experiments
in the distillation of gas, in the course of which there was trouble
with the pumps, and a continual series of breakages and leakages, so that the
middle of April came before I had secured any further satisfaction than to demonstrate
that <em class="italic">possibly</em> the boilers might have a capacity sufficient for the work
laid out for them to do; but subsequent experiments showed that even in this
I was mistaken, for it was only after additional jets had been put in between the
coils that I succeeded in getting an effective horse-power of 0.43 out of the
combination.</p>

<p>Finally, on the 14th of April, after having reduced the capacity of the pumps
to the dimensions given above (for the stroke was originally 1.25 inch) I obtained
the development of 1 full horse-power by the engine for 41 seconds, with a steam
pressure of 100 pounds per square inch, and a rate of revolution of 720 per
minute. But at the end of this brief period, the shafts sprung and the worm
was thrown out of gear.
<span class="xxpn" id="p038">[p038]</span></p>

<p>I pass over numerous other experiments, for their only result was to make
it clear that the aerodrome, as it had been constructed, could not be made to
work efficiently, even if its great weight had not served as a bar to its flight. It
was, therefore, decided to proceed with the construction of another.</p>

<p>After the failure of the first steam-driven model No. 0, which has just been
described, subsequent light models were constructed. These, three in number,
made with a view to the employment of carbonic acid or compressed air, but
also to the possible use of steam, are shown in Plate <a href="#plt010">10</a>, Nos. 1, 2, 3; on the same
scale as the larger model which had preceded them. In describing these, it will
be well to mention constructive features which were experimented on in them,
as well as to describe the engines used.</p>

<p>In No. 1, which was intended to be on about
<span class="fract"><span class="fup">2</span><span class="fdn">5</span></span>
the linear scale of No. 0, the
constructive fault of the latter, that of making the support depend on a too
flexible hull, was avoided, and the straight steel tube (“midrod” it will hereafter
be called) was carried through from end to end, though at the cost of inconvenience
in the placing of the machinery, in what may be called the hull, which
now became simply a protective case built around this midrod. The mistaken
device of the long shafts meeting at an angle, was, however, retained, and the
engines first tried were a pair of very light ones of crude construction.</p>

<p>These were later replaced by a pair of oscillating engines, each 3 cm. diameter
by 3 cm. stroke, with a combined capacity of 42 cubic cm. and without
cut-off. The midrod was made of light steel tubing 2 cm. outside diameter.
The framing for the hull was formed by a single ring of U section, 8 cm. across
and 18 cm. in depth, stayed by five ribs of wood measuring 0.7&#160;× 0.3 cm. The inclined
propeller shafts, which were connected by a pair of bevel gears as in No.
0, were made of tubing 0.5 cm. outside diameter, and were intended to turn propellers
of from 40 to 45 cm. in diameter. The weight, without engine or reservoir
for gas, was 1161 grammes. With a weight equivalent to that of the intended
reservoir and engines plus that of the proposed supporting surfaces, the whole
weight, independent of fuel or water, was 2.2 kilogrammes.</p>

<p>The engines, which were not strong enough to sustain a pressure of over 2
atmospheres, at an actual pressure of 20 pounds drove the 45 cm. propellers
through the long V shafts and lifted only about
<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">7</span></span>
of the flying weight of the machine.
The power developed at the Prony brake was collectively only about .04
horse-power, giving 1200 turns a minute to two 40 cm. propellers. This was the
best result obtained.</p>

<p>This aerodrome was completed in June, 1892, but changes in the engines and
other attempted improvements kept it under experiment until November of that
year, when it appeared to be inexpedient to do anything more with it.</p>

<p>Aerodrome No. 2 (see Plate <a href="#plt010">10</a>), was a still smaller and still lighter construction,
in which, however, the midrod was bent (not clearly shown in the <span class="xxpn" id="p039">[p039]</span> photograph),
so as to afford more room in the hull. This introduced a constructional
weakness which was not compensated by the added convenience, but the principal
improvement was the abandonment of the inclined propeller shafts, which
was done at the suggestion of Mr. J. E. Watkins, so that the propellers were
carried on parallel shafts as in marine practice. These parallel shafts were
driven by two very small engines with cylinders 2.3 cm. in diameter by 4 cm.
stroke, with a collective capacity of 33 cu. cm. and without cut-off, which were
mounted on a cross-frame attached to the midrod at right angles near the rear
end of the hull.</p>

<p>These engines, driven either by steam or by carbonic-acid gas developed
0.035 horse-power at the Prony brake, giving 750 revolutions of the 45 cm. propellers,
and lifting about
<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">5</span></span>
of the total weight which it was necessary to provide
for in actual flight. A higher rate of revolution and a better lift were occasionally
obtained, but there was little more hope with this than with the preceding
models of obtaining power enough to support the actual weight in flight, although
such sacrifices had been made for lightness that every portion of the little model
had been reduced to what seemed the limit of possible frailty consistent with
anything like safety. Thus the midrod was lighter than that of No. 1, being
only 1 cm. in outside diameter. The frame was made of thin wooden strips 5
mm.&#160;× 3.5 mm., united by light steel rings. The cross framing carrying the engines
was also of wood, and was formed of four strips, each 7 mm.&#160;× 3 mm.
The shafts were but 4 mm. in diameter.</p>

<p>As these engines did not give results that were satisfactory, when using
carbonic-acid gas, experiments were commenced to secure a boiler that would
furnish the requisite steam. As the “beehive” boiler had proved to be too
heavy, and as the steam obtained from it had been inadequate to the requirements,
something else had to be devised. A few of the boilers used in 1892 are
shown in Fig. 3. The one marked <em class="italic">A</em> is one of the “beehives,” while an element
of another form tried is that marked <em class="italic">B</em>. It consisted of
<span class="nowrap"><span class="fract"><span class="fup">3</span><span class="fdn">8</span></span>-inch</span>
copper tubes
joined to a drum of 10-oz. copper. This was made in May, 1892, and was tested
to a pressure of 50 atmospheres, when it burst without any tearing of the metal.</p>

<p>In July another boiler like that shown at <em class="italic">C</em> in Fig. 3 was made. This
was formed of tubes 3 cm. in diameter, and weighed 348 grammes. It carried
about 300 grammes of water and stood a steam pressure of 125 pounds per
square inch, but failed to maintain sufficient steam pressure.</p>

<p>Accordingly, in the same month, a third boiler like that shown at <em class="italic">D</em> was built.
It consisted of a tube 12 inches long to which were attached fifteen
<span class="nowrap"><span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">4</span></span>-inch</span> tubes
each 7 inches long, in the manner shown. The heating surface of this boiler,
including the tubes and the lower half of the drum, amounted to 750 square cm.,
and it was thought that this would be sufficient to supply steam for a
flight of a <span class="xxpn" id="p040">[p040]</span>
minute and a half. But when a test was made, it also was found to be deficient
in steaming power even after changes were made in it which occupied much time.</p>

<p>By the first of October, 1892, there had been built one large aerodrome that
could not possibly fly, a smaller one, No. 1, on
<span class="fract"><span class="fup">2</span><span class="fdn">5</span></span>
the linear scale of No. 0, with
a pair of engines but no means of driving them, and the still smaller No. 2 with
a boiler that was yet untried.</p>

<p>Aerodrome No. 3 (Plate <a href="#plt010">10</a>) was an attempt to obtain better conditions than
had existed in the preceding model without any radical change except that of
moving the cross frame, which carried the engines and propellers, nearer the
front of the machine. Instead of the oscillatory engines used up to this time,
two stationary cylinder engines, each 2.4 cm. in diameter and 4 cm. stroke, having
a combined capacity of 36 cu. cm. without cut-off were employed for driving
the propellers. The engines, though occasionally run in trials with steam from
a stationary boiler, were intended to be actuated either by compressed air or
carbonic-acid gas contained in a reservoir which was not actually constructed,
but whose weight was provisionally estimated at 1 kilogramme. The weight of
the aerodrome without this reservoir was but 1050 grammes, including the estimated
weight of the sustaining surfaces, which consisted principally of two wings,
each about 1 metre in length by 30 cm. in breadth and which were in fact so slight
in their construction, that it is now certain that they could not have retained their
shape in actual flight.</p>

<p>The only trials made with this aerodrome, then, were in the shop, of which
it is sufficient to cite those of November 22, 1892, when under a pressure of 30
pounds, the maximum which the engines would bear, two 50 cm. propellers were
driven at 900 revolutions per minute, with an estimated horse-power of 0.07,
about 35 per cent of the weight of the whole machine being lifted. This was a
much more encouraging result than any which had preceded, and indicated that
it was possible to make an actual flight with the aerodrome if the boilers could
be ignored, the best result having been obtained only with carbonic acid supplied
without limit from a neighboring ample reservoir.</p>

<p>This aerodrome was also tested while mounted upon a whirling-arm and
allowed to operate during its advance through the air. The conclusion reached
with it at the close of 1892, after a large part of the year passed in experiments
with carbonic-acid gas and compressed air, was that it was necessary to revert
to steam, and that whatever difficulties lay in the way, some means must be found
of getting sufficient power without the weight which had proved prohibitory in
No. 0.</p>

<p>With this chapter, then, and with the end of the year 1892, I close this very
brief account of between one and two years of fruitless experiment in the construction
of models supplied with various motors, subsequent to and on a larger
scale indeed than the toy-like ones of india rubber, but not even so efficient as
those had been, since they had never procured a single actual flight.</p>

CHAPTER V<br />
ON SUSTAINING SURFACES
</h3></div>

<p>The following general considerations may conveniently precede the particular
description of the balancing of the aerodrome.</p>

<p>In “Experiments in Aerodynamics,” I have given the result of trials, showing
that the pressure (or total resistance) of a wind on a surface 1 foot square,
moving normally at the velocity of 1 foot per second, is 0.00166 pounds, and that
this pressure increases directly as the surface of the plane, and (within our experimental
condition) as the square of the velocity,<a id="fnanchor_20" href="#footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> results in general accordance
with those of earlier observers.</p>

<p>I have further shown by independent investigations that while the shape of
the plane is of secondary importance if its movement be normal, the shape and
“aspect” greatly affect the resultant pressure when the plane is inclined at a
small angle, and propelled by such a force that its flight is horizontal, that is,
under the actual conditions of soaring flight.</p>

<p>I have given on page 60 of “Aerodynamics,” the primary equations,</p>

<div class="equationbox">

“lift”); <em class="italic">R</em> the horizontal component of pressure (sometimes called the “drift”);

<p>It cannot be too clearly kept in mind that these values refer to <em class="italic">horizontal</em>
flight, and that for this the weight, the work, the area, the angle and the velocity
are inseparably connected by the formulæ already given.</p>

<p>It is to be constantly remembered also, that they apply to results obtained
under almost perfect theoretical conditions as regards not only the maintenance
of equilibrium and horizontality, but also the rigid maintenance of the angle α
and the comparative absence of friction, and that these conditions are especially
“theoretical” in their exclusion of the internal work of the wind observable
in experiments made in the open wind.</p>

</h4>

<p>I have pointed out<a id="fnanchor_21" href="#footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> that an indefinite source of power for the maintenance
of mechanical flight, lies in what I have called the “internal work” of the
wind. It is easy to see that the actual effect of the free wind, which is filled with
almost infinitely numerous and incessant changes of velocity and direction, must
differ widely from that of a uniform wind such as mathematicians and physicists
have almost invariably contemplated in their discussions.</p>

<p>Now the artificial wind produced by the whirling-table differs from the real
wind not only in being caused by the advancing object, whose direction is not
strictly linear, and in other comparatively negligible particulars, but especially
in this, that in spite of little artificial currents the movement on the whole is
regular and uniform to a degree strikingly in contrast with that of the open wind
in nature.</p>

<p>In a note to the French edition of my work, I have called the attention of the
reader to the fact that the figures given in the Smithsonian publication can
show only a small part of the virtual work of the wind, while the plane, which is
used for simplicity of exposition, is not the most advantageous form for flight;
so that, as I go on to state, the realization of the actually successful aerodrome
must take account of the more complex conditions actually existing in nature,
which were only alluded to in the memoir, whose object was to bring to attention
the little considered importance of the then almost unobserved and unstudied
minute fluctuations which constitute the internal work of the wind. I added
that I might later publish some experimental investigations on the superior efficiency
of the real wind over that artificially created. The experiments which
were thus alluded to in 1893, were sufficient to indicate the importance of the subject,
but the data have not been preserved.</p>

<p>What immediately follows refers, it will be observed, more particularly to
the work of the whirling-table.

</h4>

<p>In order to get a more precise idea of the character of the alteration introduced
into these theoretical conditions by the variation of any of them, let us,
still confining ourselves to the use of the whirling-table, suppose that the plane
in question while possessing the same weight, shape, and angle of inclination,
were to have its area increased, and to fix our ideas, we will suppose that it became
4 square feet instead of 1 as before. Then, from what has already been
said, <em class="italic">V</em>, the velocity, must vary inversely as the square root of the area; that is,
it must, under the given condition, become one-half of what it had been, for if
<em class="italic">V</em> did not alter, the impelling force continuing the same, the plane would rise
and its flight no longer be horizontal, unless the weight, now supposed to be constant,
were itself increased so as to restore horizontality.</p>

<p>I have repeated Table XIII under the condition that the area be quadrupled,
while all the other conditions remain constant, except the soaring speed, which
must vary.</p>

<p>The reader is reminded that these are simply deductions from the equations
given in “Aerodynamics,” and that these deductions have not been verified by
direct trial, such as would show that no new conditions have in fact been introduced
in this new application. While, however, these deductions cannot convey
any confidence beyond what is warranted by the original experiments, in their
general trustworthiness as working formulæ at this stage of the investigations,
we may, I think, feel confidence.</p>

<p>I may, in view of its importance, repeat my remark that the relation of area
and weight which obtain in practice, will depend upon yet other than these theoretical
considerations, for, as the flight of the free aerodrome cannot be expected
to be exactly horizontal nor maintained at any constant small angle, the <span class="xxpn" id="p044">[p044]</span>
data of “Aerodynamics” (obtained in constrained horizontal flight with the
whirling-table) are here insufficient. They are insufficient also because these
values are obtained with small rigid planes, while the surfaces we are now to use
cannot be made rigid under the necessary requirements of weight, without the
use of guy wires and other adjuncts which introduce head resistance.</p>

<p>Against all these unfavorable conditions we have the favoring one that, other
things being equal, somewhat more efficiency can be obtained with suitable curved
surfaces than with planes.<a id="fnanchor_22" href="#footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></p>

<p>I have made numerous experiments with curves of various forms upon the
whirling-table, and constructed many such supporting surfaces, some of which
have been tested in actual flight. It might be expected that fuller results from
these experiments should be given than those now presented here, but I am
not yet prepared to offer any more detailed evidence at present for the performance
of curved surfaces than will be found in Part III.<a id="fnanchor_23" href="#footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> I do not question that
curves are in some degree more efficient, but the extreme increase of efficiency in
curves over planes understood to be asserted by Lilienthal and by Wellner, appears
to have been associated either with some imperfect enunciation of conditions
which gave little more than an apparent advantage, or with conditions
nearly impossible for us to obtain in actual flight.</p>

<p>All these circumstances considered, we may anticipate that the power required
(or the proportion of supporting area to weight) will be very much greater
in actual than in theoretical (that is, in constrained horizontal) flight, and the
early experiments with rubber-driven models were in fact successful only when
there were from three to four feet of sustaining surface to a pound of weight.
When such a relatively large area is sought in a large aerodrome, the construction
of light, yet rigid, supporting surfaces becomes a nearly insuperable difficulty,
and this must be remembered as consequently affecting the question of the
construction of boiler, engines and hulls, whose weight cannot be increased without
increasing the wing area.</p>

<h3 title="Chapter VI Balancing the Aerodrome">CHAPTER VI<br />
BALANCING THE AERODROME
</h3></div>

<p>By “balancing” I mean such an adjustment of the mean center of pressure
of the supporting surfaces with reference to the center of gravity and to the line
of thrust, that for a given speed the aerodrome will be in equilibrium, and will
maintain steady horizontal flight. “Balance” and “equilibrium” as here used
are nearly convertible terms.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">L<span class="smmaj">ATERAL</span></span>
<span class="smcap">S<span class="smmaj">TABILITY</span></span></h4>

<p>Equilibrium may be considered with reference to lateral or longitudinal stability.
The lateral part is approximately secured with comparative ease, by imitating
Nature’s plan, and setting the wings at a diedral angle, which I have usually
made 150°. Stability in this sense cannot be secured in what at first seems
an obvious way—by putting a considerable weight in the central plane and far
below the center of gravity of the aerodrome proper, for this introduces rolling.
Thence ensues the necessity of carrying the center of gravity more nearly up
to the center of pressure than would otherwise be necessary, and so far introducing
conditions which tend to instability, but which seem to be imposed upon us
by the circumstances of actual flight. With these brief considerations concerning
lateral stability, I pass on to the far more difficult subject of longitudinal
stability.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">L<span class="smmaj">ONGITUDINAL</span></span>
<span class="smcap">S<span class="smmaj">TABILITY</span></span></h4>

<p>My most primitive observation with small gliding models was of the fact
that greater stability was obtained with two pairs of wings, one behind the
other, than with one pair (greater, that is, in the absence of any instinctive
power of adjustment).</p>

<p>This is connected with the fact that the upward pressure of the air upon
both pairs may be resolved into a single point which I will call the “center of
pressure,” and which, in stable flight, should (apart from the disturbance by the
propeller thrust) be over the center of gravity. The center of pressure in an
advancing inclined plane in soaring flight is, as I have shown in “Aerodynamics,”
and as is otherwise well known, always in advance of the center of figure,
and moves forward as the angle of inclination of the sustaining surfaces diminishes,
and, to a less extent, as horizontal flight increases in velocity. These facts
furnish the elementary ideas necessary in discussing this problem of equilibrium,
whose solution is of the most vital importance in successful flight.
<span class="xxpn" id="p046">[p046]</span></p>

<p>The solution would be comparatively simple if the position of the <em class="italic">CP</em> could
be accurately known beforehand, but how difficult the solution is may be realized
from a consideration of one of the facts just stated, namely, that the position
of the center of pressure in horizontal flight shifts with the velocity of the flight
itself, much as though in marine navigation the trim of a steamboat’s hull were
to be completely altered at every change of speed. It may be remarked here
that the center of pressure, from the symmetry of the aerodrome, necessarily
lies in the vertical medial plane, but it may be considered with reference to its
position either in the plane <em class="italic">XY</em> (<em class="italic">cp</em><sub>1</sub>) or in the
plane <em class="italic">YZ</em> (<em class="italic">cp</em><sub>2</sub>). The latter center
of pressure, as referred to in the plane <em class="italic">YZ</em>, is here approximately calculated
on the assumption that it lies in the intersection of this vertical plane by a horizontal
one passing through the wings half way from root to tip.</p>

<p>Experiments made in Washington, later than those given in “Aerodynamics,”
show that the center of pressure, (<em class="italic">cp</em><sub>1</sub>) on a plane at slight angles of inclination,
may be at least as far forward as one-sixth the width from the front edge.
From these later experiments it appears probable also that the center of pressure
moves forward for an increased speed even when there has been no perceptible
diminution of the angle of the plane with the horizon, but these considerations
are of little value as applied to curved wings such as are here used. Some
observations of a very general nature may, however, be made with regard to the
position of the wings and tail.</p>

<p>In the case where there are two pairs of wings, one following the other, the
rear pair is less efficient in an indefinite degree than the front, but the action
of the wings is greatly modified by their position with reference to the propellers,
and from so many other causes, that, as a result of a great deal of experiment,
it seems almost impossible at this time to lay down any absolute rule with
regard to the center of pressure of any pair of curved wings used in practice.</p>

<p>Later experiments conducted under my direction by Mr. E. C. Huffaker,
some of which will appear in Part III, indicate that upon the curved surfaces I
employed, the center of pressure moves forward with an increase in the (small)
angle of elevation, and backward with a decrease, so that it may lie even behind
the center of the surface. Since for some surfaces the center of pressure moves
backward, and for others forward, it would seem that there might be some other
surface for which it will be fixed. Such a surface in fact appears to exist in the
wing of the soaring bird. These experiments have been chiefly with rigid surfaces,
and though some have been made with elastic rear surfaces, these have
not been carried far enough to give positive results.</p>

<p>The curved wings used on the aerodromes in late years have a rise of one
in twelve, or in some cases of one in
eighteen,<a id="fnanchor_24" href="#footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a>
and for these latter the following
empirical local rule has been adopted:
<span class="xxpn" id="p047">[p047]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The center of pressure on each wing with a horizontal motion of 2000 feet
per minute, is two-fifths of the distance from front to rear. Where there are
two pairs of wings of equal size, one following the other, and placed at such a
distance apart and with such a relation to the propellers as here used, the following
wing is assumed to have two-thirds of the efficiency of the leader per unit
of surface. If it is half the size of the leader, the efficiency is assumed to be one-half
per unit of surface. If it is half as large again as the leader, its efficiency
is assumed to be eight-tenths per unit of surface. For intermediate sizes of following
wing, intermediate values of the
efficiency may be assumed.</p></div>

<p>These rules are purely empirical and only approximate. As approximations,
they are useful in giving a preliminary balance, but the exact position of
the center of pressure is rarely determinable in either the horizontal or vertical
plane, except by experiment in actual flight. The position of the center of gravity
is found with all needed precision by suspending the aerodrome by a plumb-line
in two positions, and noting the point of intersection of the traces of the
line, and this method is so superior to that by calculation, that it will probably
continue in use even for much larger constructions than the present.</p>

<p>The principal factor in the adjustment is the position of the wings with reference
to the center of gravity, but the aerodrome is moved forward by the thrust
of its propellers, and we must next recall the fact of experiment that as it is for
constructional reasons difficult to bring the thrust line in the plane of the center
of pressure of the wings, it is in practice sufficiently below them to tend to tip
the front of the aerodrome upward, so that it may be that equilibrium will be
attained only when <em class="italic">CP</em><sub>1</sub> is <em class="italic">not</em> over <em class="italic">CG</em><sub>1</sub>.</p>

<p>In the discussion of the equilibrium, then, we must consider also the effect
of thrust, and usually assume that this thrust-line is at some appreciable distance
below the center of pressure.</p>

<p>We may conveniently consider two cases:</p>

<p>1. That the center of pressure is not directly over the center of
gravity; that is, <em class="italic">CG</em><sub>1</sub>−<em class="italic">CP</em><sub>1</sub>&#160;= <em class="italic">a</em>, and estimate what the
value of a should be in order that, during horizontal flight, the
aerodrome itself shall be horizontal; or,
<span class="xxpn" id="p048">[p048]</span></p>

<p>2. Consider that the center of pressure is directly over the center of gravity
(<em class="italic">CP</em><sub>1</sub>−<em class="italic">CG</em><sub>1</sub>&#160;= 0), and in this case inquire what angle the aerodrome itself may
take during horizontal flight.</p>

<p>First case. The diagram (Fig. 4) represents the resultants of the separate
system of forces acting on the aerodrome, and these resultants will lie in a vertical
medial plane from the symmetry of their disposition.</p>

<p>Let <em class="italic">af</em> represent the resultant of the vertical components of the pressure on
the wings; the horizontal component will lie in the line <em class="italic">ae</em>.</p>

</div>

<p>Let the center of gravity be in the line <em class="italic">bd</em>, and the resultant thrust of the
propellers be represented by <em class="italic">cd</em>.</p>

<p>Let <em class="italic">W</em>&#160;= weight of aerodrome.</p>

<p>Let <em class="italic">T</em>&#160;= thrust of propellers.</p>

<p>Then if we neglect the horizontal hull resistance, which is small in comparison
with the weight, equilibrium obtains when <em class="italic">W</em>&#160;×
<em class="italic">ab</em>&#160;= <em class="italic">T</em>&#160;×
<em class="italic">bd</em>.</p>

<p>Second case. The diagram (Fig. 5) represents the same system of forces
as Fig. 4, but in this case the point of support is directly over the center of
gravity <em class="italic">g</em>, when the axis of the aerodrome is horizontal.</p>

<p>Let <em class="italic">W</em>&#160;= weight of aerodrome.</p>

<p>Let <em class="italic">T</em>&#160;= thrust of propellers.</p>

<p>Let <em class="italic">R</em>&#160;= distance of <em class="italic">CG</em><sub>2</sub> below <em class="italic">CP</em><sub>2</sub>&#160;= <em class="italic">ag</em>.</p>

<p>Let <em class="italic">S</em>&#160;= distance of thrust-line below <em class="italic">CP</em><sub>2</sub>&#160;= <em class="italic">ad</em>.</p>

<p>If now the aerodrome under the action of the propellers be supposed to
turn about the <em class="italic">CP</em><sub>2</sub> (or, <em class="italic-padr">a</em>) through an angle α, so that <em class="italic">g</em>
takes the position <em class="italic">g′</em>, we <span class="xxpn" id="p049">[p049]</span>
obtain by the decomposition of the force of gravity an element
<em class="italic">g′k</em>&#160;= <em class="italic">W</em> sin α
which acts in a direction parallel to the thrust-line.</p>

<p>If we again neglect the horizontal hull resistance, equilibrium
will be obtained when</p>

<p>The practical application of these rules is greatly limited by the uncertainty
that attaches to the actual position of the center of pressure, and this fact and
also the numerical values involved may be illustrated by examples.</p>

<p>The weight was 12.5 kilos. On November 28, the steam pressure was less

<p class="continue">The doubt as to the actual position of the resultant center of pressure, then, renders
the application of the rule uncertain. In practice, we are compelled (unfortunately)
after first calculating the balance, by such rules as the above, and
after it has been thus found with approximate correctness, to try a preliminary
flight. Having witnessed the actual conditions of flight, we must then readjust
the position of the wings with reference to the center of gravity, arbitrarily,
within the range which is necessary. This readjustment should be small.</p>

6. Diagram showing effect of Pénaud tail.</div>
</div>

<p>In the preceding discussion it has been assumed that, if there is a flat tail or
horizontal rudder, it supports no portion of the weight. This is not an indispensable
condition but it is very convenient, and we shall assume it. In this
case the action of the so-called Pénaud rudder becomes easily intelligible. This
is a device, already referred to in Chapter II <a href="#tocontents">◊</a>, made by Alphonse Pénaud for the
automatic regulation of horizontal flight, and it is as beautiful as it is simple.</p>

<p>Let <em class="italic">AB</em> (Fig. 6) be a schematic representation of an aerodrome whose supporting
surface is <em class="italic">Bb</em>, and let it be inclined to the horizon at such an angle α
that its course at a given speed may be horizontal. So far it does not appear
that, if the aerodrome be disturbed from this horizontal course, there is any
self-regulating power which could restore it to its original course; but now let
there be added a flat tail <em class="italic">AC</em> set at an angle&#160;−α with the wing. This tail serves
simply for direction, and not for the support of the aerodrome, which, as already
stated, is balanced so that the <em class="italic">CG</em> comes under the <em class="italic">CP</em> of the wing <em class="italic">Bb</em>.</p>

<p>It will be seen on a simple inspection that the tail under the given conditions
is horizontal, and that, presenting its edge to the wind of advance, it offers no
resistance to it, so that if the front rises and the angle α increases, the wind will
strike on the under side of the tail and thereby tend to raise the rear and depress
<span class="xxpn" id="p051">[p051]</span>
the front again. If the angle α diminish, so that the front drops, the wind will
strike the upper surface of the tail, and equally restore the angle α to the amount
which is requisite to give horizontal flight. If the angle α is not chosen originally
with reference to the speed so as to give horizontal flight, the device will still
tend to continue the flight in the straight line which the conditions impose,
whether that be horizontal or not.</p>

<p>From this description of its action, it will be seen that the Pénaud tail has
the disadvantage of giving an undulatory flight, if the tail is made rigid. This
objection, however, can be easily overcome by giving to it a certain amount of
elasticity. It does not appear that Pénaud gave much attention to this feature,
but stress is laid upon it in the article “Flight,”
in the ninth edition of the Encyclopædia
Britannica, and I have introduced a simple device for securing it.</p>

<p>The complete success of the device implies a strictly uniform velocity and
other conditions which cannot well he fulfilled in practice. Nevertheless, it is as
efficient a contrivance for its object as has yet been obtained.</p>

<p>More elaborate devices have been proposed, and a number of them, depending
for their efficiency upon the action of a variety of forces, have been constructed
by the writer, one of which will be described later. This has the advantage
that it tends to secure absolutely horizontal flight, but it is much inferior
in simplicity to the Pénaud tail.</p>

<p>Apart from considerations about the thrust, the <em class="italic">CP</em> is in practice always
almost directly over the <em class="italic">CG</em>, and this relationship is, according to what has been
suggested, obtained by moving the supporting surfaces relatively to the <em class="italic">CG</em>, or
<em class="italic">vice versa</em>, remembering, however, that, as these surfaces have weight, any movement
of them alters the <em class="italic">CG</em> of the whole, so that successive readjustments may
be needed. The adjustment is further complicated by another important consideration,
namely, that those parts which <em class="italic">change</em> their weight during flight (like
the water and the fuel) must be kept very near the <em class="italic">CG</em>. As the water and fuel
tanks are fixed, it appears, then, that the center of gravity of the whole is practically
fixed also, and this consideration makes the adjustment a much more
difficult problem than it would be
otherwise.<a id="fnanchor_25" href="#footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></p>

<h3 title="Chapter VII History of Construction of Frame and
Engines of Aerodromes">CHAPTER VII<br />HISTORY OF
CONSTRUCTION OF FRAME AND ENGINES OF AERODROMES</h3></div>

<p>During the years 1892 and 1893, it will be recalled, four aerodromes, known
as Nos. 0, 1, 2, and 3, had been built, which were of two general types of construction.
First, that represented by No. 0, in which a radically weak hull was made
to support rods at the front and rear, to which the wings and tail were attached.
This aerodrome was abandoned on account of the inability to provide it with
sufficient power, as well as because of its constructional weakness. Second, that
type represented by Nos. 1, 2, and 3, in which a midrod was carried through
from front to rear, around which the hull supporting the machinery was built.
These models were much lighter than No. 0, but were all abandoned because
it was found impossible to propel even the lightest of them. While all these
machines were in the strictest sense failures, inasmuch as none of them was
ever equipped with supporting surfaces, yet the experience gained in the construction
of them was of the very greatest value in determining the points at
which strength was needed, and in indicating the mode of construction by which
strength and rigidity could be obtained.<a id="fnanchor_26" href="#footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></p>

<h4>1893</h4>

<p>Another aerodrome, known as No. 4 (shown in Plate <a href="#plt011">11</a>), was designed in
the latter part of 1892, and by the end of March, 1893, its construction was well
under way. It was of the second type, in that the midrod was continuous, but
it differed from the preceding forms in having the machinery (boilers, burners,
and tanks) attached directly to the midrod, the hull now taking the form of a
mere protective sheathing. As in Nos. 2 and 3, two engines were used, which
were mounted on a cross-frame of light tubing attached to the midrod at right
angles. It had, as at first constructed, no provision for the generation of steam,
but only for carrying a reservoir of carbonic acid to supply gas for the engines.</p>

<p>The whole, including wings, tail, and engines, but without the carbonic acid
reservoir, weighed 1898 grammes (4.18 lbs.). A cylindrical reservoir, weighing
521 grammes (1.14 lbs.) and capable of holding 1506 cu. cm. (92 cu. in.) was
constructed for this purpose, and tested for 30 minutes with a pressure of 100 <span class="xxpn" id="p054">[p054]</span>
atmospheres. If the weight of the cylinder, with its contents and adjuncts, be
taken as 800 grammes (1.76 lbs.), the total weight of the aerodrome was 2698
grammes (5.95 lbs.). The wings were plane surfaces of silk, stretched over a
very light frame, with no intermediate ribs to prevent the wing from being completely
distorted by the upward pressure of the air. Even if they had been sufficiently
strong and stiff, the total surface of both wings and tail was but 2601 sq.
cm. (2.8 sq. ft.) or approximately 0.5 sq. ft. of supporting surface to the pound,
much less than was found adequate, even under the most favorable circumstances.
The weight was much more than had been contemplated when the
wings were designed, yet, if all the other features of the aerodrome had been
satisfactory, and sufficient power had been secured, the work of providing suitable
supporting surfaces would have been attempted. But as it was found that
the engines when supplied with carbonic-acid gas were unable to develop anything
like the power necessary to propel the aerodrome, and that the construction
could be greatly improved in many other ways, this aerodrome was entirely
rebuilt. The work of the engines with carbonic acid had been so completely unsatisfactory
that the idea was entirely abandoned, and no further attempts to
develop an efficient motor other than steam were made.</p>

<p>It now became realized more completely than ever before that the primary
requisite was to secure sufficient power, and that this could be obtained only by
the use of steam. This involved a number of problems, all of which would have
to be solved before any hope of a successful machine could be entertained. In
the first place, engines of sufficient power and strength, but of the lightest possible
construction, must be built. Second, a boiler must be constructed of the
least possible weight, which would develop quickly and maintain steadily steam
at a high enough pressure to drive the engines. This demanded some form of
heating apparatus, which could work under the adverse condition of enclosure
in a narrow hull, and steadily supply enough heat to develop the relatively large
quantity of steam required by the engines.</p>

<p>The first of these problems, that of procuring suitable engines, was at least
temporarily solved by the construction of two engines with brass cylinders,
which had a diameter of 2.4 cm. (0.95 in.), and a piston stroke of 5 cm. (1.97 in.).
The valve was a simple slide-valve of the piston type, arranged to cut off steam
at one-half stroke. No packing was used for the piston or the valve, which were
turned to an accurate fit to the cylinder and the steam-chest respectively. In
the engines built up to this time, the parts had frequently been soldered together,
and a great deal of trouble and delay had arisen from this cause. In these new
engines, however, as strong and careful a construction was made as was possible
within the very narrow limits of weight, with the result that the engines,
though by no means as efficient as those constructed later, were used in all the
experiments of 1893 and also during the first part of 1894.
<span class="xxpn" id="p055">[p055]</span></p>

<p>As soon as these engines were completed, in February, 1893, a test was
made of one of the cylinders, steam being supplied from the boiler of the shop-engine.
The experiments were made with the Prony brake, and showed that at
a speed of 1000 revolutions per minute, the power developed from a single cylinder
was 0.208 H. P., with a mean effective pressure in the cylinder of only about
21 pounds per square inch of piston area, allowing a loss of 25 per cent for the
internal resistance of the engine. This pressure was so much less than should
have been obtained with the steam pressure used, that it now seems evident that
the steam passages and ports were too small to admit and exhaust the steam with
sufficient rapidity to do the work with the same efficiency that is obtained in
common practice. This, however, was not immediately recognized. The piston
speed at 1000 R. P. M. was 328 feet per minute, at which speed the steam at a
pressure of 80 pounds should have been able to follow up the piston and maintain
almost, if not quite, full boiler pressure to the point of cut-off, but it did
not do so.</p>

<p>The problem of generating steam was much more difficult and required a long
and tedious series of experiments, which consumed the greater part of the year
before any considerable degree of success had been attained. In the course of
these experiments many unexpected difficulties were encountered, which necessitated
the construction of special forms of apparatus, which will be described
at the proper point. Numerous features of construction, which seemed to be of
value when first conceived, but which proved useless when rigorously tested, will
be noted here, whenever a knowledge of their valuelessness may seem to be of
advantage to the reader.</p>

<p>The boiler was necessarily developed simultaneously with the development
of the heating apparatus, and in the following pages, as far as possible, they will
be treated together; but often for the sake of clearness and to avoid repetition,
separate treatment will be necessary.</p>

<p>At the beginning of these experiments, there was much doubt as to whether
alcohol or gasoline would be found most suitable for the immediate purpose.
An alcohol burner had been used in connection with the earliest aerodrome, No.
0, but from the results obtained with it at that time, there seemed to be little
reason to hope for success with it. It is to be premised that the problem, which
at first seemed insoluble, was no less than to produce steam for something like
1 H. P. by a fire-grate, which should occupy only a few cubic inches (about the
size of a clenched hand) and weigh but a few ounces. It had to be attacked,
however, and as alcohol offered the great advantage of high calorific properties
with freedom from all danger of explosion, it was at first used.</p>

<p>Early in 1893, it occurred to me to modify the burner so as to make it essentially
an aeolipile, and in April of that year the first experimental aeolipile model
shown at <em class="italic">A</em> (Plate <a href="#plt012">12</a>) was made. It was very small and intended for the <span class="xxpn" id="p056">[p056]</span>
demonstration of a principle rather than for actual service, but the construction of
this small aeolipile was an epoch in the history of the aerodrome. It furnished
immensely more heat than anything that had preceded it, and weighed so little
and worked so well that in May the aeolipile marked <em class="italic">B</em> was made. In this design
two pipes were led from the upper portion of the cylinder, one to a large
Bunsen burner which heated the boiler, the other to a small burner placed under
the tank to vaporize the alcohol. This was followed by the one shown at <em class="italic">C</em>,
wherein the heating burner was smaller and the gas pipe, leading to the main
burner, larger.</p>

<p>Figures <em class="italic">D</em>, <em class="italic">E</em>, <em class="italic">F</em>, and <em class="italic">G</em> (Plate <a href="#plt012">12</a>)
were really continuations and improvements
of the same idea. In <em class="italic">C</em> there was simply a tube or flue through the tank;
in <em class="italic">F</em>, however, this tube discharged into a smoke-stack fastened to the end of the
cylinder, while in <em class="italic">G</em> the flue turned upward within the tank itself and discharged
into the short stack on top. The object of these changes was to increase the draft
and heating power of the small flame, so that the gas would be more rapidly
generated and a greater quantity be thus made available for use under the boiler
in a unit of time. They were, however, though improvements in a construction
which was itself a great advance, still inadequate to give out a sufficient amount
of heat to meet the excessive demands of the required quantity of steam. The boilers
in connection with which these aeolipiles were used must now be considered.</p>

<p>The first boiler <em class="italic">E</em> (Plate <a href="#plt013">13</a>) made during this year was a double-coil boiler
of the Serpollet type, formed of 19 feet of copper tubing having an internal diameter
of about
<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">8</span></span>
inch. Attached to the boiler was a small vertical drum, from
the top of which steam was led to the engine, a pipe from the bottom leading to
the pump. This boiler was tested in April with an alcohol heater, the pump in
this trial being worked by hand. This apparatus developed a steam pressure
varying from 25 to 75 pounds, which caused the engines to drive a 60 cm. propeller
of 1.25 pitch-ratio 565 revolutions per minute. The greatest difficulty was
experienced in securing a sufficient and uniform circulation in the boiler coils.
The action in the present case was extremely irregular, as the pressure sometimes
rose to 150 pounds, driving the engines at a dangerous speed and bending
the eccentric rod, while at other times it would fall so low that the engines stopped
completely.</p>

<p>As the pump used in this trial had proved so unsatisfactory and unreliable,
it was replaced by a reservoir of water having an air-chamber charged to
10 atmospheres, the flow from which could apparently be regulated with the
greatest nicety by a needle valve at the point of egress; but for some reason
its performance was unsatisfactory and remained so after weeks of experiment.</p>

</div>

<p>There was used in connection with this device the double-coil boiler shown
at <em class="italic">F</em> (Plate <a href="#plt013">13</a>) which was made of tubes flattened so as to be nearly capillary.
The idea of this was to obtain a larger heating surface and a smaller volume of <span class="xxpn" id="p057">[p057]</span>
water, so that by proper regulation at the needle valve, just that quantity would
be delivered which could be converted into steam in its passage through the
coils, and be ready for use in the engines as it left the boiler at the farther extremity.
The results obtained from this were an improvement over those from
the original coil, and a third set of coils (<em class="italic">G</em>, in Plate <a href="#plt013">13</a>) was made. This boiler
consisted of three flattened tubes superposed one over another.</p>

<p>These two boilers were tried by placing them in a charcoal fire and turning
on an alcohol blast, while water from a reservoir under constant air pressure
was forced through them past a pin valve. The result was that the two-stranded
coil supplied steam at from 10 to 40 pounds pressure to run the engines at about
400 revolutions per minute. The pressure rose steadily for about 40 seconds
and then suddenly fell away, though the coils were red-hot, and neither the water
nor the alcohol was exhausted—apparently because of the irregularity of the
supply of water, due to the time taken by it after passing the valve to fill the
considerable space intervening between that point and the boiler.</p>

<p>An attempt was made to overcome this difficulty by putting a stop-cock directly
in front of the boiler so that the water, while still under the control of the
needle valve, could be turned in at once; the alcohol blast was also arranged to
be turned on or off at pleasure, and provision was made, by taking out the end
of the flue inclosing the boiler, to provide for an increased air supply. With this
arrangement a flame eight or nine inches long was obtained, but a test showed
that not more than 25 grammes of water per minute passed through the tubes,
which was not enough.</p>

<p>Further tests with these boilers were so far satisfactory as to show that
with the flattened-tube Serpollet boiler, comprising from 60 to 80 feet of tubing,
from 80 to 100 pounds pressure of steam could be maintained, but not steadily.
As there were difficulties in flattening the tubes to make a boiler of this sort, a
compromise was effected in the construction of the one shown at <em class="italic">H</em> (Plate <a href="#plt013">13</a>),
which was made of light copper tubes 5 mm. in diameter, laid up in three lengths
of 6 metres each. The ends of these coils were so attached to each other that the
water entering at one end of the smallest coil would pass through it and then
enter the middle coil, whence it passed through the third or outer coil. Two
sets of these coils were made and placed in the thin sheathings shown in the
photograph. Repeated experiments with these boilers demonstrated that the
pressure did not rise high enough in proportion to the heat applied, and that
even the pressures obtained were irregular and untrustworthy. The principal
difficulty still lay in maintaining an active and uniform circulation through the
coils, and for this purpose the water reservoir under constant air pressure had
proved itself inadequate. This pointed to a return to the use of the force pump,
the construction of which had hitherto presented so many special difficulties that
it had been temporarily abandoned.
<span class="xxpn" id="p058">[p058]</span></p>

<p>A further difficulty experienced in the use of these boilers had been that of
obtaining <em class="italic">dry</em> steam for the engines, as during the early experiments the steam
had been delivered directly into the engines from the boiler coils. But in August
the writer devised a chamber, known as the “separator,” where it had an opportunity
to separate from the water and issue as dry steam, or at least approximately
dry steam. This was an arrangement familiar in principle to steam engineers
under another form, but it was one of the many things which, in the ignorance
of steam engineering the writer has already freely admitted, he had to
reinvent for himself.</p>

<p>At about the same time, a new pump was designed to drive the water from
the bottom of the separator, which served the double purpose of steam drum and
reservoir, into the coils. This pump had a diameter of 4.8 cm., and was run at
180 strokes per minute.</p>

<p>The result of the first experiments with these improvements demonstrated
that, within certain limits, the amount of water evaporated is proportional to the
circulation, and in this boiler the circulation was still the thing that was at fault.
Finally, the results of the experiments with the two-stranded, triple-coil boiler
may be summed up in the statement that it was possible to maintain a pressure
of 80 pounds, and that with it the engines could be made to develop from 0.3 to
0.4 H. P. at best. It weighed 650 grammes (1.43 pounds) without the asbestos
jacket.</p>

<p>About this time the writer had the good fortune to secure the temporary
services of Dr. Carl Barus, an accomplished physicist, with whose aid a great
variety of boilers were experimented on.</p>

<p>The next form of boiler tested was that shown at <em class="italic">N</em> (Plate <a href="#plt013">13</a>), made on a
system of coils in parallel, of which there were twenty complete turns. In the
first test it generated but 20 pounds of steam, because the flame refused to work
in the colder coils. The work of this boiler was very unsatisfactory, and it was
only with the greatest difficulty that more than ten pounds pressure could be
maintained. There was trouble, too, with the circulation, in that when the flame
was in full play the pump seemed to meet an almost solid resistance, so that it
could not be made to do its work.</p>

<p>A new boiler was accordingly made, consisting of three coils of four strands
each. With this the pump worked easily, but whereas it was expected to get 120
pounds pressure, the best that could be obtained was 70 pounds. The outer
coil was then stripped off, and a trial made in which everything ran smoothly
and the pressure mounted momentarily to 90 pounds. After some adjustment,
a mean pressure of 80 pounds was obtained, giving 730 revolutions of the engine
per minute, with an indicated horse-power of 0.32.</p>

<p>It was shown in this work that, within certain limits, steam is generated
most rapidly when it is used most rapidly, so that two engines could be used <span class="xxpn" id="p059">[p059]</span>
almost as well as one, the reason apparently being that the rapid circulation increased
the steam generating power of the boiler, and that the engines worked
best at about 80 pounds. It was also found that a larger tubing was better than
the small, weight for weight, this fact being due to the greater ease with which
circulation could be maintained, since fewer coils were necessary in order to
obtain the same external heating surface. The pressure in the coils and the
separator was also much more nearly equalized. The result was that the boiler
temporarily approved was one made of tubing 6.35 mm. (0.25 inch) in diameter,
bent into a two-coil, two-stranded boiler, having sixteen complete turns for each
strand in each coil. The total weight was 560 grammes (1.23 pounds) with a
total heating surface of 1300 sq. cm. (1.4 sq. ft.).</p>

<p>The separator used in the experiments made during August and September
was of a form in which the water was forced below a series of partitions that
prevented it from following the steam over into the cylinders of the engines. It
weighed 410 grammes (0.9 pound) and was most conveniently worked with 700
grammes (1.54 pounds) of water. The boiler and separator together weighed
970 grammes (2.1 pounds).</p>

<p>A new separator was, however, designed, which was horizontal instead of
vertical, as it was intended that it should be placed just below the midrod. Another
form, devised for constructional reasons, consisted of a cylinder in which
a pump was imbedded. Heretofore the pump used had been single-acting, but it
was now proposed to make a double-acting pump. Upon testing this apparatus,
it was found that when using an aeolipile, it took 150 grammes of alcohol to
evaporate 600 grammes of water. It was evident that the latter was used very
wastefully, so that the thermal efficiency of the engine was not over one per cent;
but it was also evident that, under the necessity of sacrificing everything to lightness,
this waste was largely inevitable.</p>

<p>About the middle of October, another boiler (O, Plate <a href="#plt013">13</a>) was made, which
consisted of two coils wound in right and left hand screw-threads, one fitting
loosely over the other, so as to make a cylindrical lattice-work 32 cm. (12.6 in.)
long. Each coil contained two strands of copper tube 0.3 mm. thick, and weighing
54 grammes to the metre (0.036 pound to the foot). The inner coil had a
diameter of 5.63 cm. (2.22 in.), with nine turns of tube to the strand, the two
strands making a length of 319 cm. (10.5 feet) for the coil. The outer coil had
a mean diameter of 6.88 cm. (2.71 in.) and a length of 388 cm. (12.7 feet) for the
two strands. The total length of the two coils was, therefore, 707 cm. (23.2 feet),
with a heating surface of about 1415 sq. cm. (1.52 sq. ft.) and a total weight of
382 grammes (0.84 pound).</p>

<p>The results obtained with this boiler were so far satisfactory as to show that,
under the most favorable conditions, when air was supplied in unlimited quantities
and there were no disturbing currents to put out or interfere with the work <span class="xxpn" id="p060">[p060]</span>
of the burners, steam could be supplied at a sufficient pressure to run the engines.
It was realized, however, that the conditions in flight would be very different,
and that in order to protect the apparatus from the wind, some sort of
protecting covering would have to be devised, which would of itself introduce
new difficulties in providing the burners with a proper and uniform draft.</p>

10. Diagram of pendulum.</div>
</div>

<p>The hull, as at first constructed, consisted of a cylindrical sheathing open in
front, through the rear end of which the boiler and aeolipile projected inward,
so that the air taken in at the front would be drawn through the boiler and hearth
to the exclusion of lateral currents. In the first tests, however, after the hull had
been applied, it was impossible to secure a proper rate of combustion, nearly the
whole hull being filled with a bluish flame, while only a very small portion of the
gases of combustion passed into the coils of the boiler. The remedy for this lay in
obtaining an increased draft, and a small stack was, therefore, arranged to carry
off the products of combustion. This proved inadequate, and it was only after
several weeks of experiment with various types of smoke-stack, and constant
alteration of the aeolipile, that it was possible to make the apparatus work <span class="xxpn" id="p061">[p061]</span>
efficiently when it was inside the hull. Finally such a degree of success was attained
that the burners could be kept lighted even when the aerodrome was placed in a
considerable artificial breeze, created by a blower in the shop.</p>

<p>In connection with these tests of the engines and boilers, some method was
desired, in addition to the Prony brake tests, by which the thrust of the propellers
when driven by the engines at various speeds could be measured accurately
and in terms which would be readily available in judging whether the aerodromes
were ready to be given an actual trial in free flight. Such a method was found
in the use of an apparatus known as the “pendulum,” which was introduced
near the end of 1892, but was not generally used until the end of 1893. After
this time, however, this test was made a condition prerequisite to taking any of
the aerodromes into the field, and proved of the greatest assistance in estimating
the probable outcome of the trials.</p>

<p>The apparatus used, which is diagrammatically shown in Fig. 10, was extremely
simple both in theory and operation. It consisted primarily of a horizontal
arm <em class="italic">AC</em> carrying the knife-edge <em class="italic">B</em> by which it is pivoted on each side on
supporting beams not shown. Depending from <em class="italic">AC</em> is the light vertical arm <em class="italic">DE</em>,
rigidly joined to it and carrying the lower horizontal arm <em class="italic">FG</em>, all of which are
braced together so as to maintain the arm <em class="italic">DE</em> constantly perpendicular to <em class="italic">AC</em>.
To this arm <em class="italic">FG</em> the model was rigidly attached with its center of gravity in line
with the vertical arm <em class="italic">DE</em> and its weight increased by the addition of properly
disposed flat weights, in order to make the angle of lift for a given thrust of the
propellers smaller and less likely to interfere with the working of the boiler and
separator.</p>

<p>Before the actual test of the “lift” could be made, it was necessary to know
the exact distance of the vertical center of gravity of the model and the extra
weights from the knife-edge <em class="italic">B</em>. This was determined by the following method:
A known weight was suspended from the arm <em class="italic">AB</em> at some arbitrarily selected
distance from the point <em class="italic">B</em>. This weight caused the perpendicular arms <em class="italic">AB</em> and
<em class="italic">DE</em> to rotate through an angle, θ, which was measured on the scale <em class="italic">KL</em>. Knowing,
then, the weight on the arm <em class="italic">AB</em>, its point of application, the weight of the
aerodrome suspended on the arm <em class="italic">DE</em>, and the angle of rotation, it is easy, by a
simple application of trigonometric functions, to determine the distance of the
center of gravity of the model from the point <em class="italic">B</em>.</p>

<p>In a test of Aerodrome No. 6 made on September 23, 1898, the weight suspended
from <em class="italic">AB</em> was 10,000 grammes, its point of application 50 cm., the model
was weighted to 20,450 grammes, and the angle of rotation, θ, was 7° 2′. Letting
y equal the distance of the <em class="italic">CG</em> from <em class="italic">B</em>, we may equate the balanced forces thus:</p>

<div class="equationbox"><div class="inlineblk">
<div class="left"> 10,000×50 cos 7° 2′&#160;= 20,450×<em class="italic">y</em> sin 7° 2′</div>
<div class="left">10,000×50 cot 7° 2′&#160;= 20,450<em class="italic">y</em></div>
<div class="center"><em class="italic">y</em>&#160;= 198.2 cm.</div>
</div></div>

<div class="xxpn" id="p062">[p062]</div>

<p>Having determined this distance, the weight on <em class="italic">AB</em> was removed and the
aerodrome was allowed to regain its former position. The distance of the center
of thrust from <em class="italic">B</em> was then measured. The engine was next started and the number
of revolutions of the propellers counted by a tachometer. The thrust of the
propellers, acting perpendicularly to the arm <em class="italic">BD</em>, produced rotation around the
point <em class="italic">B</em>, the angle of which was measured as above.</p>

<p>In the power test of No. 6, the following data were obtained:</p>

<ul><li><em class="italic">W</em>&#160;= weight of aerodrome&#160;= 20,450 grammes.</li>

<li>θ&#160;= angle of lift&#160;= 19° 30′.</li>

<li>Distance of <em class="italic">CG</em> from center of rotation&#160;= 198.2 cm.</li>

<li>Distance of center of thrust from center of rotation&#160;= 186.3 cm.</li></ul>

<p class="continue">As the propeller thrust and the weight of the model are forces acting in opposite
directions at known distances from a center of rotation, letting <em class="italic">L</em> equal the “dead
lift,” we may express the equation thus:</p>

<div class="equationbox"><div class="inlineblk">
<div class="left"><em class="italic">W</em> sin θ&#160;×
 198.2&#160;= <em class="italic">L</em>&#160;× 186.3,</div>
<div class="left"><em class="italic">L</em>&#160;=
 <span class="fract"><span class="fup">198.2</span><span class="fdn">186.3</span></span>&#160;×
 sin 19° 30′&#160;× 20,450,</div>
<div class="left"><em class="italic">L</em>&#160;= 7,263 grammes “dead lift.”</div>
</div></div>

<p class="continue">The flying weight of Aerodrome No. 6 was 12,064 grammes, and the per cent of
this weight lifted was, therefore,</p>

<div class="equationbox"><div class="inlineblk">
<div class="left"><span class="fract"><span class="fup">7,263</span><span class="fdn">12,064</span></span>&#160;= 60.3.</div>
</div></div>

<p>This was much more than was necessary for flight, but in order to insure
successful flights and avoid delay, the rule was made in 1895 that no aerodrome
was to be launched until it had previously demonstrated its ability to generate
enough power to maintain for at least two minutes a lift of 50 per cent of the
total flying weight. At the same time other important data were obtained, such
as the steam-pressure, the time required to raise sufficient steam, the total time
of the run, and the general working of the boilers and engines.</p>

<p>As will easily be seen, these tests afforded a most satisfactory basis of judging
what the aerodromes might be expected to do in actual flight if the balancing
were correct.</p>

<p>At this time, October, 1893, the aerodrome (Old No. 4) was practically
complete, and the most anxious thought was given to lightening it in every way
consistent with the ever-present demand for more power, which necessitated an
increase in the weight of both burners and boilers to supply the requisite steam.</p>

<p>On November 14, when the aerodrome was prepared to be shipped to Quantico
for trial, its condition was about as follows. The steam-generating apparatus—the
parts of which were of substantially the forms last described, although
some slight improvements had been introduced—had been developed to
<span class="xxpn" id="p063">[p063]</span>
such a point that a pressure of from 70 to 80 pounds of steam could be maintained
for 70 seconds, when it was tested in the shop. What it would do under
the unfavorable conditions imposed by flight was to be learned only by trial.</p>

<p>At this pressure, the engines, the efficiency of which had been increased by
an improvement in packing, would develop approximately 0.4 indicated H. P.,
while at 105 pounds pressure they at times developed as much as 0.8 H. P.
When the aerodrome was tested on the pendulum, these engines, when making
less than 700 revolutions per minute, lifted over 40 per cent of the total flying
weight.</p>

<p>The propellers used at this time were accurate helices, having a
diameter of 60 cm., a width of blade of approximately 36 degrees,
and a pitch-ratio of 1.25. They were formed of wood, and were bushed
with brass where they were attached to the shafts.</p>

<div class="xxpn" id="p064">[p064]</div>

<p>The total flying weight of Old No. 4, including fuel and water, was 4132
grammes (9.1 lbs.), a much larger weight than had been contemplated when
the original designs were made. A detailed statement of the weights of the
various parts of the aerodrome, together with some data as to its density, is
given on the preceding page. There were provided in the wings and tail approximately
2 sq. ft. of supporting surface to the pound of weight, which would
have been barely sufficient to sustain the aerodrome, even if it had been successfully
launched and the wings had been built much stronger than the flimsy construction
in use at this time.</p>

<p>An air chamber, which served the double purpose of floating the aerodrome
and of providing a moveable weight by which the center of gravity could be
shifted to the proper position relatively to the center of pressure, was constructed
of the thinnest sheet-iron and attached to the midrod.</p>

<p>This aerodrome, the fifth in actual construction, and the first, after years of
experiment, to be carried into the field, was transported to Quantico, where the
first trial with it was made on November 20, under the conditions described in
Chapter IX <a href="#tocontents">◊</a>.</p>

<h4>1894</h4>

<p>The aerodrome, No. 4, which has just been described, had not been put to the
test of an actual flight, for reasons connected with the difficulties of launching,
which are more fully described elsewhere; but, when the completed machine was
more fully studied in connection with the unfavorable conditions which it was
seen would be imposed on it in trials in the open air, many possibilities for improvement
presented themselves. It was seen, for instance, that a better design
might be made, in which the engines, boiler and aeolipile might be placed so that
the center of gravity of each would lie in the same vertical plane as the central
line of the aerodrome. In order to do this the construction of a single midrod,
which was the distinguishing feature of Old No. 4, had to be essentially departed
from, the midrod of this new one, No. 5, being opened out into two rods, so to
speak, which were bent out so that the open space between them furnished a
sufficiently large hull space to hold the entire power generating apparatus. In
arranging the machinery within this hull, it was provided that, as the water and
fuel were expended, the center of gravity of the aerodrome would shift little,
and, if at all, backward relatively to the center of pressure.</p>

<p>Instead of the two small engines, which it will be remembered were mounted
on the cross-frame in No. 4, a single engine with a larger cylinder, having a diameter
of 3.3 cm. (1.3 in.) and a stroke of 7 cm. (2.76 in.), capable of developing
about 1 H. P. was used. This engine was mounted within the hull near the forward
end and drove the propellers by suitable gearing.
<span class="xxpn" id="p065">[p065]</span></p>

<p>In addition to these radical changes many important improvements were
made in the different parts. Internal compartments were built in the separator,
so that even if the water was displaced by the pitching of the aerodrome, it
could still perform its functions properly. The pump was provided with a ratchet,
so that it could be worked by hand after the burners were lighted, and before
enough steam had been raised to enable the engine to run it. An active circulation
was thus maintained in the coils of the boiler as soon as the burner was
lighted and before the engine was started, which prevented the tubing from being
burnt out, as had frequently happened previously. The wing construction
was also improved and many other changes were introduced, which will be treated
separately.</p>

<p>In the meantime, No. 4, which had been damaged in the attempted launching
in November, 1893, was strengthened and prepared for another trial which took
place in January, 1894.</p>

<p>By the end of the first week in February, the engine of No. 5 was ready for
trial, and with a boiler pressure of about 80 pounds per square inch, apparently
developed 0.56 H. P. on the Prony brake, when making 800 revolutions per minute.
To accomplish this called for such good distribution of steam in the cylinder,
that it is doubtful if the power could be exceeded at that speed and
pressure.</p>

<p>It was, however, apparent that it was desirable to have a boiler capable of
supplying steam for at least one horse-power, and that in order to do this, there
must be an improvement in the aeolipiles. The problem consisted in arranging
to evaporate more than 500 cu. cm., and in fact as nearly as possible 1000 cu.
cm. (61 cu. in.) of water per minute, and, since from 200 to 300 cu. cm. per
minute had already been evaporated, this was not regarded as impossible of accomplishment.
The theoretical advantages of gasoline had for a long time been
recognized, as well as the very practical advantage possessed by it of keeping
lighted in a breeze, and several attempts had been made during the latter part
of the previous year to construct a suitable burner for use with it. These had
not been very successful; but in view of the increasing demand for a flame of
greater efficiency than that of the alcohol aeolipiles, it was decided to resume
the experiments with it.</p>

<p>Accordingly, a gasoline evaporator was tried, consisting in the first experiment
of a gasoline tank with nine flues, through which steam was passed.
A flow of steam gave a rapid evaporation of gasoline when the pressure did not
exceed 5 pounds. The chief difficulty with the burner employed was that the
supply of gasoline gas would rise and fall as the steam rose and fell, conditions
just the opposite of what was really desired. On the other hand, it was thought
that this gasoline tank would form a real condenser for the steam, so that a <span class="xxpn" id="p066">[p066]</span>
portion of the exhaust steam would be condensed and be available for use in the
boiler again. The gasoline vapor had many advantages over the alcohol; but it
was at first possible to evaporate only 120 cu. cm. of gasoline in a minute.</p>

<p>In the experiments that were made at this time (March 9) with gasoline,
the main object in view was to obtain a smooth blue flame at 10 pounds pressure.
There had been failures to accomplish this, owing to the high boiling point of
the liquid, and while the work was in progress it was still evident that the problem
of the boiler and the flame which was to heat it had not been solved. A Prony
brake test gave, at 130 pounds pressure, 1.1 H. P. with about 1000 revolutions
of the propellers; but this was with steam supplied from the boiler of the stationary
shop engine.</p>

<p>On April 1, 1894, the following record was made of the condition of Aerodrome
No. 5:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“The wings, the tail, and the two 80 cm. propellers, as well as the two smaller
propellers, are ready. The cylinders, gear, pump, and every essential of the
running gear, are in place. The boilers, separators, and adjuncts are still under
experiment, but may be hoped to be ready in a few days. At present, the boilers
give from 450 to 600 grammes of mixed steam and water per minute. With 130
pounds of steam, the engine has actually developed at the brake, without cut-off,
considerably more than 1 H. P., so that it may be confidently considered that
at 150 pounds, with cut-off, it will give at least 0.8 H. P., if it works proportionately
well.”</p></div>

<p>The delays incident to the accomplishment of the work in hand were always
greater than anticipated, as is instanced by the fact that it was the latter part
of September before the work was actually completed. The greater part of this
delay was due to the necessity for a constant series of experiments during the
spring and summer to determine the power that it was possible to obtain with
the various styles of boilers, aeolipiles, and gasoline burners.</p>

<p>While No. 5 was thus under construction, new and somewhat larger engines
had been built for No. 4, the work on them having been begun in January. The
cylinders of these engines, which are more fully described in connection with
Aerodrome No. 6, were 2.8 cm. in diameter, with a 5 cm. stroke, each cylinder
thus having a capacity of 30.8 cu. cm., which was an increase of 36 per cent
over that of the old brass cylinder engines, which had previously been used on
No. 4. On April 28, under a pressure of 70 pounds, these engines drove the
two 60 cm. propellers at a rate of 900 R. P. M., and lifted on the pendulum nearly
40 per cent of the total flying weight of Aerodrome No. 4, which was now approximately
5 kilos. A trial was made at Quantico in the latter part of May,
which is described in Chapter IX <a href="#tocontents">◊</a>. It is only necessary to mention in this connection
that there was a great deal of trouble experienced with the alcohol aeolipile,
the flame being extinguished in the moderate wind to which the <span class="xxpn" id="p067">[p067]</span>
aerodrome was subjected while preparations for the launch were being made. Moreover
the flame was so nearly invisible in the sunlight that it was uncertain
whether it was burning in the critical instants just before the launch, when doubt
might be fatal. These conditions resulted in a final decision in favor of gasoline,
on account of its greater inflammability, and in the provision of such hull
covering that the fires could be lighted and maintained in a breeze.</p>

<p>In June, I tried a modification of the burner, in which the gasoline was delivered
under the pressure of air to the evaporating coil. In the first trial steam
was raised to a final pressure of about 70 pounds, and a run of 45 seconds was
secured under a pressure of 40 pounds in the gasoline tank, which was thought
to be altogether too high; for, at the end of the run, the whole apparatus was
enveloped in flames, because of the gasoline that was projected through the
burner-tips.</p>

<p>Continual experiments with different forms of burner, illustrated in Plate
<a href="#plt012">12</a>, occupied the time, with delays and imperfect results, which were trying to the
investigator, but are omitted as of little interest to the reader. They had, however,
the incidental result of proving the practical superiority of gasoline over
alcohol, and culminated in the evolution of the burner that was finally used
successfully. It consisted of a tank for the gasoline, from which compressed
air delivered the liquid to a small coil surrounded by asbestos, in which it was
vaporized. At the rear end of this coil three pipes were led off, one of which
was a small “bleeder,” which fed the burner for heating the gasoline, the other
two leading to the main burners. After the generation of gas in the small coil
had been started, the heat from the small burner was expected to continue the
vaporization, so that nothing but gas would be able to reach the main burners.
A device was also introduced, which had greatly increased the amount and uniformity
of the draft and consequently made the burners and boilers more efficient
than before. This consisted simply in passing the exhaust steam from the
engines into the smoke-stack, and it is remarkable that it was not thought of
earlier.</p>

<p>By the middle of September, 1894, both aerodromes were completed and
ready for another test. On September 27 the condition of Aerodrome No. 4
was as follows: The general type of construction, namely, that of a single
midrod, to which all the steam generating apparatus was attached, and which
supported also the cross-frame and the wings, was the same as in the construction
of 1893. On account of the increased weight of the model, and the substitution
of an inferior piece of tubing in place of the former midrod, it was found
necessary to stiffen it by the use of temporary trusses. Permanent bearing
points for holding the aerodrome securely to the newly devised launching apparatus
were also attached to this midrod.
<span class="xxpn" id="p068">[p068]</span></p>

<p>The engines in use at this time were the small steel cylinders described
above, which were mounted on the cross-frame, and drove the propellers directly.
These engines were capable of delivering to the propellers, as had been proved
by repeated tests, at least 0.66 brake horse-power.</p>

<p>The boiler consisted of two inner coils and an enveloping outer coil, loosely
wound and connected in series. The inner coils, each of which had about 17
turns of 8 mm. diameter, 0.2 mm. thick tubing, developed about 80 per cent of
the steam; the outer coil of 8 turns, while not exactly useless as a steam generator,
afforded an efficient means of fastening the smoke-stack and cover of the
boiler, and for attaching the latter to the midrod. This boiler was externally
30 cm. long, 16 cm. wide, and 10 cm. deep, weighing with its cover approximately
650 grammes. The stack for the burnt gases, into which exhaust steam was led
from a central jet, was about 1 foot long. At best this boiler was capable of
developing slightly over 100 pounds of steam.</p>

<p>The separator was of the form last described, except that the steam dome
had been moved toward the front, to prevent the jerk of the launching car in
starting from causing water to be pitched over into the engines. It was constructed
of sheet aluminum-bronze, and weighed, together with its pump, 580
grammes. The pump, which was double-acting and fitted with ball valves, was
capable of discharging 4.5 grammes of cold water per stroke, its efficiency being
only about one-half as great with hot water.</p>

<p>The gasoline burner, which had been finally adopted in place of the alcohol
aeolipiles, had now been perfected to the form in which it was finally used. Two
Bunsen burners of special construction were provided with gasoline gas by the
heat of an intermediate accessory burner, which played upon a coil to which all
three burners were connected. Gasoline was furnished from a tank made of
aluminum-bronze, under an air pressure of about 20 pounds, the fluid being under
the control of a screw stop-cock. This tank, which was capable of holding
100 to 150 cu. cm. of gasoline, weighed 180 grammes, and the burners with an
outer sheathing weighed 302 grammes.</p>

<p>It was calculated that about 3300 cu. cm. (201 cu. in.) of air space would be
required to float the aerodrome in water, and this was supplied by an air chamber,
having a capacity of 2700 cu. cm. (165 cu. in.), which could be shifted to
adjust the longitudinal equilibrium of the aerodrome, and about 900 cu. cm. (55
cu. in.) of space in the gasoline tank and the midrod. The reel and float, which
served to indicate the location of the aerodrome, if for any reason it should be
submerged, were in one piece, and so moored that there was no danger of fouling
the propellers.</p>

<p>The total weight of the aerodrome was about 6 kilogrammes (13.2 lbs.), or,
with a maximum quantity of fuel (850 cu. cm. of water, 150 cu. cm. of gasoline), <span class="xxpn" id="p069">[p069]</span>
less than 7 kilogrammes. From 60 to 90 pounds of steam could be maintained
by the boilers for about 2 minutes, at which pressure the engines developed about
0.66 brake horse-power, driving the 70 cm., 1.25 pitch-ratio propellers at 700 R.
P. M., and giving a lift of from 2.6 to 3.0 kilos (5.7 to 6.6 pounds), or about 40
per cent of the flying weight.</p>

<p>The wings and tail had a total surface of 2.62 sq. m. (28.2 sq. ft.), giving a
ratio of 2.7 kilos to 1 sq. m. of wing surface (1.8 sq. ft. per pound). If the hull
resistance be neglected, the soaring speed of this aerodrome was about 5.9 metres
(19 feet) per second, or 13 miles per hour.</p>

<p>Turning now to the completed No. 5, its frame was of the “double midrod”
type described above, the two tubes which formed the frame being prolonged
at the front and rear to afford points of attachment for the wings and
tail. The range through which the wings could be shifted to adjust the position
of the center of pressure was, however, very small. The hull, which, it will be
remembered, contained all the power generating apparatus, was much stronger
and heavier than that of No. 4, and resembled somewhat the hull of a ship. It
had a frame-work of steel tubing brazed to the midrod, to which an outer
sheathing of sheet aluminum 0.3 mm. thick was attached. It was, however, excessively
heavy, weighing nearly 800 grammes.</p>

<p>The engine, which was mounted near the front of the hull, was the single
cylinder, one horse-power engine, described above, which drove the two propellers
by suitable gearing. The remaining parts of the power plant were identical
with those already described in connection with No. 4, but the more advantageous
location of them in No. 5 rendered them somewhat more efficient.</p>

<p>It had been planned to use 80 cm. propellers of 1.25 pitch-ratio on No. 5, but
it was found in the shop tests of the aerodrome that the cross-frame was not
strong enough to withstand the strains, and that the engine could be made to
work much more steadily with a smaller propeller. Accordingly, propellers of
70 cm. diameter and 1.25 pitch-ratio, similar to those used on No. 4, were finally
substituted.</p>

<p>For floating the aerodrome, when it descended into the water, an air-chamber
similar to that of No. 4, but of a larger capacity was provided. With this in
place on the aerodrome, it was calculated that, if all the parts except this float
and the gasoline tank were filled with water, there would still be a buoyancy of
over 2 kilogrammes.</p>

<p>The total weight of No. 5 was 8200 grammes, or with its full supply of fuel
and water 9200 grammes. In this aerodrome the same boilers used in No. 4
were capable of maintaining for at least a minute 115 pounds of steam, so that
the engine now gave the maximum of one brake horse-power for which it was
designed, and, driving the 70 cm. propellers, lifted repeatedly nearly 45 per cent
of the flying weight.
<span class="xxpn" id="p070">[p070]</span></p>

<p>The wings and tail constructed for No. 5 were identical with those of No. 4,
being slightly curved and containing 2.62 sq. m. (28.2 sq. ft.), equivalent to 1.4
sq. ft. to the pound, which with the flimsy construction of the wings gave an entirely
inadequate support to the aerodrome.</p>

<p>During the summer a launching apparatus of a new and improved type,
which is described in Chapter X <a href="#tocontents">◊</a>, had been perfected, and with it repeated tests
were made of both aerodromes in October, November, and December, with the unsatisfactory
results recorded in Chapter IX <a href="#tocontents">◊</a>. In the course of these experiments,
many slight modifications of the burners and boilers were made, but no important
changes were introduced except that the cross-frame of No. 5 was enlarged and
strengthened so as to admit of its carrying one metre propellers safely. The
results, however, which were obtained, did not compensate for the increased
weight of the larger frame.</p>

<p>Viewing the work of this year from the standpoint of results obtained in
the numerous attempts at flight, it would seem that very little progress had been
made, and that there was small reason to expect to achieve final success. However,
if the work be examined more particularly, it will be seen that two of the
most difficult problems had been solved, one completely as far as the models
were concerned, and the other to a very satisfactory degree. First, a launching
apparatus, with which it was possible to give the aerodrome any desired initial
velocity, had been devised, and so far perfected that no trouble was ever experienced
with it in testing the models. Second, as a result of the extended and
systematic series of experiments, which had been conducted under the direction
of Dr. Barus, a steam pressure of 115 pounds could be maintained steadily in
the boilers for at least a minute, and the burners could be kept lighted even in
a considerable breeze.</p>

<p>A summary of these experiments, together with some account of the difficulties
encountered and the results finally obtained with the apparatus in use
at the end of the year, is given in the following report, which was prepared by
Dr. Barus in December, 1894.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“If water be sprayed upon a surface kept in a permanent state of ignition,
any quantity of steam might be generated per time unit. Similarly advantageous
conditions would be given if threads of water could be passed through a
flame. In practice this method would encounter two serious difficulties, the importance
of which is accentuated when the boiler apparatus is to be kept within
the degree of lightness essential in aerodromics. These difficulties are (1) the
danger of chilling the flame below the point of ignition or of combustion of the
gases, and (2) the practical impossibility of maintaining threads of water in
the flame. For it is clear that the threads must be joined in multiple arc, so
as to allow a large bulk of water to circulate through the boiler, whereas even
when there are but two independent passages for the water through the furnace,
it is hard to keep both supplied with liquid without unduly straining the pump.
If the water be even slightly deficient, circumstances will arise in which one of <span class="xxpn" id="p071">[p071]</span>
the passages is better than the other. This conduit will then generate more steam
and drive the water under force through the other passage, increasing the temperature
discrepancy between them. Eventually the hot passage reaches ignition
and either bursts or melts. This is what sooner or later takes place in
boilers adapted for flying machines and consisting of tubes joined in multiple
arc, when a single moderately strong circulating pump supplies the system.</p>

<p>“To avoid these annoyances, <em class="italic">i. e.</em>, to increase the length of life of the
boiler, the boiler tubes are joined in series to the effect that a single current of
water may flow successively through all of them. It is needful therefore to
select wide tubes, such as will admit of an easy circulation in consideration of the
length of tubing employed without straining the pump and at the same time to
allow sufficient room for the efflux of steam. Other considerations enter here,
the bearing of which will be seen presently: if the tube be too wide the difficulty
of coiling it on a mandrel of small diameter is increased, while at the same time
the tube loses strength (<em class="italic-padr">cæt. par.</em>) in virtue of the increased width.</p></div>

</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“It is from considerations such as these that, in the course of many experiments,
copper tubing about 8 mm. in diameter has been adopted. Copper is
selected because of its freedom from internal corrosion, easy coiling, and because
of its availability in the market. The thinnest tube to be had (walls only
0.1 mm. thick) will withstand more pressure than can be entrusted to the larger
steam receivers in circuit with the boiler. The boiler weight is thus a negligible
factor, and it is quite feasible to reduce the thickness of boiler tubing, by the
superficial application of moderately strong nitric acid, to 200–400 grammes per
horse-power of steam supplied. External corrosion due to flames occurs only in
case of deficient water, and if the boiler be made of tubing with the walls 0.2
mm. thick, it is in view of the possibility of such accidents. Boilers may then
be tested to 25 atm. without endangering the metal.</p>

<p>“Boilers are wound or coiled with regard to the two points above suggested,
viz.: to avoid chilling the flame the successive turns are spaced on all sides, and
to bring the water as nearly into the flame as possible, the diameter of the coils
is chosen as small as expedient. Further reasons for this will presently be adduced.
The type of boiler eventually adopted is shown in the accompanying diagrams,
1 and 2, Fig. 11.</p>

<p>“Diagram 1, is a perspective diagram showing the plan of winding and Diagram
2, an end view. The circulation is indicated. There are two inner coils <span class="xxpn" id="p072">[p072]</span>
each containing about 17 turns, wound on a mandrel 5 cm. in diameter. The turns
are spaced so as to allow about 1 cm. clear between successive turns. The outer
coil envelopes both, and in this there are about 3 cm. between successive turns,
and 8 turns in all. Length, say, 30 cm., breadth 16 cm., thickness 10 cm., give
the external dimensions of the boiler. The shell space between outer and inner
layers of tubing must nowhere be less than 1 cm. When so wound, the inner
coils (here as in other boiler forms) raise about 80 per cent or more of the steam;
the outer or enveloping coil, while not quite useless, make the most effective
frame work for the boiler jacket which has been devised. The coils are brazed
together by blind tubes, as shown in Diagram 2, to keep the whole in shape.
Weight with couplings and cover when complete 535 grammes.</p>

<p>“The cover is preferably of mica, through which the flame within the boiler
may be seen, and in which lightness, nonconduction, and resistance to the disintegrating
effects of high temperature are met with in a pronounced degree. This
jacket is held down by copper bands and the end band is continuous with the
long smoke-stack, as will be presently shown.</p>

<p>“The wide form of boiler with two coils within the envelope is not absolutely
essential. The same amount of steam can be generated from one coil in
an envelope in other respects equal to Diagram 1 if a sufficiently hot flame be
passed axially through the coils. Such a flame, however, is unstable, and for
this reason two milder flames with a good air access are to be preferred on practical
grounds even if the weight is thereby increased.</p>

<p>“To further understand the boiler construction it is advisable to consider
the action of the flame. Inasmuch as wide tubes must be used, the problem of
evaporating water as fast as possible is equivalent to getting heat into the current
(water and steam circulating through the coils) as fast as possible from
without. If, therefore, <em class="italic">t</em> is the mean temperature of the fluids within the coils,
and <em class="italic">T</em> the effective temperature surrounding the tube, then the rate at which
heat will flow into the tubes is proportional to <em class="italic">T</em>−<em class="italic">t</em>. Now <em class="italic">t</em> the temperature of
the steam is nearly constant (100°–150°) whereas <em class="italic">T</em> the effective flame temperature
may vary from 800° to, say, 1600°. It is for this reason that the heat
sponged up by the boiler depends almost directly on the flame temperature.</p>

<p>“What conditions, therefore, will make the flame effectively hot?</p>

<p>“(1) The coils must obviously be brought as nearly into the flame as feasible:
for this purpose the cylindrical helix is better than any other form. But</p>

<p>“(2) The turns and coils must not be so crowded together as to chill the
flame into imperfect combustion in various parts of its extent. Hence the loose
form of winding. Again</p>

<p>“(3) There must be oxygen enough to allow complete combustion, and</p>

<p>“(4) The flame itself must be hot and the radiation checked by good
jacketing.</p>

<p>“To take up the last points: the effective heat of the flame depends not
only on the combustion heat of the fuel used; it depends also, among other things,
on the speed with which this combustion takes place. A flame burning from a
low pressure of alcohol gas will be at low temperature as compared with a flame
burning from high pressures of the gas. If the flame be burnt from a Bunsen
burner in the usual way it is an interesting question to know how flame temperature
will vary with gas pressure. At present we know it merely in steam pressures
incidently produced in a given engine (No. 4) as for instance:</p>

<ul>
<li>Flame pressure, 10 lbs., 20 lbs., 30 lbs.</li>
<li>Steam pressure, 40 lbs., 80 lbs., 120 lbs.</li>
</ul>

<p class="continue">in the running engine.</p>

<div class="xxpn" id="p073">[p073]</div>

<p>“Unfortunately there is a limit set to this process of increasing the steam
supply, quite aside from conditions inherent in the method. This is due to the
fact that a certain speed of efflux cannot be exceeded without putting the flame
out. Suppose, for instance, in Fig. 12, that a gas generated from a liquid is
ignited at the end of the Bunsen burner <em class="italic-padr">F</em>;
then if the velocity of efflux of mixed
gas and air in the direction <em class="italic">AB</em> from the mouth of <em class="italic">F</em> exceeds the velocity of combustion
in the direction <em class="italic">BA</em>, the flame will obviously be carried away from the
mouth of the tube and dissipated. This state of things is actually realized at
pressures exceeding about 15 lbs., depending on the degree of mixture of the combustible
gases used, and therefore on apparently haphazard conditions connected
with the jet, the air holes, the air supply, etc.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If, however, the velocity of the jet at the point of efflux be checked by an
obstruction like a cylinder <em class="italic">C</em>, Fig. 13, placed co-axially with the burner tube <em class="italic">F</em>,
the speed of combustion will no longer be exceeded (supposing <em class="italic">C</em> properly chosen)
and flames will then burn from high-pressure gas. In this way flames were
maintained generated from alcohol gas at even 40 lbs. and above.</p></div>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">F<span class="smmaj">IG.</span></span> 14.</div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The gas escaping from the Bunsen burner is never sufficiently aërated to
burn completely. Otherwise there would (in general) be explosions in the tube
<em class="italic">F</em>. A part of this air is supplied at the mouth of the boiler <em class="italic">B</em>, Fig. 14, and the
amount available here will depend on the velocity of the jet <em class="italic">F</em>. Hence it does
not follow that a high-pressure burner like that in Fig. 11 will supply a proportionate
amount of heat, since its jet suction is not intense and the combustion
within the boiler is incomplete. This difficulty may be remedied by placing <span class="xxpn" id="p074">[p074]</span>
air holes in the jacket of the boiler, provided the boiler be wrapped loosely
enough not to chill the flame below ignition. It is with reference to this effect
that the boilers, Fig. 11, were wound. A number of rifts <em class="italic">aaa</em>, Fig. 15, are then
left in the jacket through which air may enter in virtue of the burner flame acting
as a jet at the mouth of the boiler.</p>

<p>“When so constructed the flame at first enters the inner coil only; but after
a little while it suddenly spreads out throughout the whole interior space and
envelops the coils. This sudden expansion is due, probably, to the assumption
of the spheroidal state by the water within the coils, the current now flaring on
an enveloping cushion of steam. The pump must work well, for deficient water
means a hot tube and deficient steam, or eventually a rupture of the tube.</p>

<p>“Thus far the dependence for draft has been on the burner jet and the suction
of the smoke-stack in virtue of the inertia of the moving gases. But even
with this ventilated boiler, this method is limited to certain dimensions of the
boiler. Thus a boiler 80 cm. long yielded about the same quantity of steam as a
boiler half as long and otherwise similar. Only the initial parts of the boiler
are, therefore, relatively efficient, and the reason of this seems to be that, apart
from shape, etc., the flame as a heat-producing agent is practically defunct, when
a certain amount of heat has been taken out of it: in other words, even with
fair ventilation the flame is eventually chilled off by the voluminous products of
combustion continually accumulating in the boiler. The same choking action accompanies
the presence of unburnt gases. If, for instance, the flame be burnt
in the air, it is slender and much smaller in volume than in the boiler. The flame
is also of small volume and burns completely in a wide boiler, but the steam is
always deficient, because of the distance between flame and coils (see above).
With the above apparatus about
<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">2</span></span>
lb. of dry steam per minute per square foot
of heating surface was attained.</p></div>

</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“This introduces the final condition for rapid steam generation. There
must be artificial suction at the smoke-stack. By passing the exhaust steam in
the form of a central jet through the smoke-stack the yield of steam was increased
20 to 30 per cent. In fact as the supply of gas from the burner is given, the
artificial suction in question means more air in the boiler for the same amount
of gas and it means also a more rapid removal of the exhaust gases. The experiments
with steam suction are yet to be completed, and with them the boiler
question is to be finally laid at rest. The chief points at issue are these:</p>

<p>“1. Seeing that the jet suction increases with the length of the smoke-stack,
up to a certain length at least, how long and how wide must the efficient smoke-stack
be made? Thus a smoke-stack 10 cm. long is all but useless. Good results
are obtained when the stack measures 30 cm. in length beyond the end of
the steam jet.
<span class="xxpn" id="p075">[p075]</span></p>

<p>“2. What is the relative efficiency of the initial and final halves of the
length of the boiler? This will show in how far it is useful to increase the
length of the boiler for a given burner and steam jet. It will also show what
advantage is to be gained from triplicate boilers with three burners, as compared
with duplicate boilers with two burners, or single boilers with one burner, <em class="italic">when
the same weight</em> of tubing is used throughout.</p>

<p>“3. What is the effect of pressure on the aeolipile tank, or in how far does
the steam generated depend on what may be called the pressure of the flame?
This is also an important point which remains for quantitative solution. It can
be approached in two ways: either by finding the steam evaporated in terms of
the tank pressure, or by finding the temperature of the flame pyrometrically.</p>

<p>“4. What speed of water circulation best conduces to steam generation?
A good pump is now installed by which the circulation can be varied. If water
can be put into the boiler just fast enough to come out dry steam at the other
end, the efficiency ought to be a maximum, but it does not follow that it will be
so, for one can imagine a wet circulation sponging up more heat than one which
is just dry at the end.”</p></div>

<h4>1895</h4>

<p>During January and February, 1895, the experiments with boilers and burners
were continued and even better and more uniform results than those given
above were obtained. The boilers of Aerodrome No. 5 were finally brought to
such a state of efficiency, that under favorable conditions a lift of nearly sixty
per cent of the flying weight was secured. This was much more than was required
for flight, but it was decided to postpone the trials until No. 4 could also
be made ready for a test and the frame of No. 5 could itself be strengthened in
many weak places.</p>

<p>Upon examining No. 4, which had been put aside since the trials in December,
it was found to have rusted so badly throughout and to be so unfit in
every way for trial, that a complete reconstruction of the whole would be necessary.
So many advantages had been gained in No. 5 by the double midrod type
of construction that it was decided to rebuild No. 4 on a modification of the same
plan, as shown in Plate <a href="#plt011">11</a>, retaining, however, the same engines which had been
used before.</p>

<p>In this a very guarded return was made to the type which had proved so
unsatisfactory in No. 0, that is, making the hull support rods at the front and
rear for attaching the wings and tail. In this case, however, the hull was constructed
very rigidly, and the tubes at the front and rear were firmly attached
and braced so that they could withstand a considerable strain without undue
distortion. The work on this frame was completed in March, but the other parts
were not in entirely efficient condition even in May, when the aerodromes were
taken to Quantico for trial. Moreover, it was found that the weight of this
aerodrome had increased far beyond the original estimates.
<span class="xxpn" id="p076">[p076]</span></p>

<p>In view of the disasters from trials in the field, due to inability to obtain
automatic equilibrium in flight and to the flexure of the large wings rather than
to defects of the engines, the conditions at this time, after three years of failure,
seemed so nearly hopeless, that without abandoning the work on these steam
aerodromes, I again had recourse to the early plan of constructing smaller models
driven by India rubber, in which the small wings employed could be made of
the requisite stiffness. Instead of employing twisted rubber, however, the defects
of which had been amply proved in previous trials, these new constructions
were meant to employ rubber directly stretched and pulling. In this condition
the rubber exercises nearly six times the power in proportion to weight
that it does when twisted, but on the other hand it requires a very strong frame
and subordinate parts.</p>

<p>I spent an inordinate amount of time and labor during this year in attempting
to employ this latter form of construction and finally got a few useful results
from it, but none in proportion to the labor expended.</p>

<p>During March, Aerodrome No. 5, the frame of which had proved on test to
be radically weak, was completely refinished except for the wings. The propellers
had hitherto been made of wood, but in May, I commenced a new construction
of steel, wood and cloth, on a plan giving a figure which, though not rigorously
helicoidal, was practically near enough to the theoretical form and was
also both lighter and more elastic than the wooden construction.</p>

<p>On May 8 and June 7 Aerodrome No. 5 was again tried at Quantico,
and although the tests were unsuccessful, in that the aerodrome failed to fly,
partly because of the fact that so much time was spent in raising steam that practically
the entire supply of fuel and water was exhausted before the aerodrome
was actually launched, yet it had come so much nearer flying than any machine
had previously done, that it was felt that if either the power could be increased
or the weight decreased even a slight amount, the aerodrome would probably
fly. In view of the great care that had been exercised in keeping down the weight,
it seemed almost hopeless to attempt to reduce it, and it also seemed equally
hopeless to attempt to get more power without increasing the weight. However,
something had to be done to increase the ratio of power to weight, and as
it was seen that this would involve extensive changes in No. 5, it was decided to
entirely rebuild No. 4 with this idea in view, though it was evident that it involved
a plan of construction even lighter than the dangerously light plan on
which No. 4 had already been constructed.</p>

<p>During Mr. Langley’s absence in Europe in the summer, Aerodrome No. 4
was entirely reconstructed and made to embody many new characteristics, the
changes introduced being so radical that this model was henceforth designated
as “New No. 4.” The new characteristics of this model were its unprecedentedly <span class="xxpn" id="p077">[p077]</span>
light frame and the elevation of the transverse frame 12 centimeters above
the midrod, whereby the position of the line of thrust was raised so that it was
20 centimetres from the center of pressure, which from theory seemed to be
very nearly its correct position. The total flying weight was but 6400 grammes
(14 pounds), with a total supporting surface of fifty-four square feet, equivalent
to very nearly four square feet per pound. It was hoped that with this extremely
light construction the “dead lift” would amount to a large percentage of the
flying weight, and as much as sixty per cent was actually lifted on the pendulum.
As, however, the aerodrome approached completion it became more and more
evident that the construction was hopelessly fragile, the frame being scarcely
able to support itself in the shop. By November this conclusion became certain,
and this aerodrome (New No. 4) was never put to an actual test in the field. The
very expensive set of wings covered with gold beater’s skin, which were also
constructed at this time for this model, proved so weak under test that they were
entirely abandoned.</p>

<p>When Mr. Langley returned to Washington in the fall, many important
points, which had been under special consideration during the past year, particularly
those relating to the disposition of sustaining surfaces, and the provision
of automatic equilibrium, were still not definitely determined. It was
not yet decided whether two sets of wings of equal area should be used for
the aerodrome, or what the efficiency per unit of area of the following surfaces was
in comparison with the leading surfaces. To aid in determining these and other
important points concerning the relative position of the center of gravity and
the center of pressure in the horizontal planes, he had several small gliding models
made, which could be used with either one or two pairs of wings, and afforded
an opportunity for testing and comparing several types of curved surfaces.</p>

<p>These models were built so that the center of gravity could be adjusted to
any desired point, and had in addition, as a means of assisting in preserving
equilibrium, a small tail-rudder, shaped somewhat like a child’s dart, which was
intended to support no part of the weight.</p>

<p>The tests with these models were very satisfactory and aided greatly in the
final development of what is known as the “Langley type.” Indeed, in the
single month of November all the points, which had hitherto been more or less
indefinite, were finally decided upon, and the tests of the following spring proved
these decisions correct.</p>

<p>Two sets of wings of equal area were hereafter provided for every aerodrome,
which not only greatly increased the stability, but also overcame the
difficulty hitherto experienced in bringing the <em class="italic">CP</em> over the <em class="italic">CG</em>. The tail-rudder,
formed of planes intersecting at right angles, was adopted as the means of control.
In use on the aerodromes it was set at a negative angle, and given a certain <span class="xxpn" id="p078">[p078]</span>
degree of elasticity, which was at first provided in the frame of the rudder, but
was later given by a flat wooden spring, by which it was attached to the aerodrome.
The tail in this form now became the sole means of controlling the
equilibrium, and the results obtained with it were so very satisfactory that no
further attention was given either to the gyroscopic control built during the previous
summer, or to any of the electrical forms of control constructed prior to
that time, all of which involved more or less delicate apparatus.</p>

<p>The definite form into which these ideas crystallized is perhaps best exemplified
in the letter of instructions issued by Mr. Langley on November 30, 1895
to the men employed on the work. The text of this letter is given in the Appendix,
and the forms referred to in it for recording the weights and adjustments
of the aerodromes are those used in the data sheets after this time.</p>

<p>In October work was resumed on Aerodrome No. 5, on which nothing had
been done since its test on June 7. The reconstruction of “Old No. 4” into
“New No. 4” which had occupied the entire summer, and the final result of
which was the production of a machine so radically weak as to be useless, had
been so discouraging that it seemed vain to attempt in any way to decrease
the weight of No. 5. The addition of the rear wings in place of the tail had,
however, so greatly increased the supporting surface that it seemed possible
that No. 5 might now be able to fly with no greater engine power than it had
on June 7. Some weak places in its frame were, therefore, strengthened and
the midrod at the front was raised five centimetres in order to raise the center
of pressure farther above the center of gravity and give the front wings a
greater range of adjustment. Some slight changes were also made in the gearing
which drove the pump, so as to make it work faster, and new burners, boilers
and a gasoline tank were constructed during November. Later the midrod, which
had formerly consisted of two separate pieces attached at the front and rear
respectively of the main frame, was made continuous, and in order to avoid
passing it through the smoke-stack, the stack was made to fork at this point.
These changes are clearly shown in Plates <a href="#plt014">14</a> and
<a href="#plt015">15</a>, which are photographs taken
on December 3. This plan was, however, soon changed so that the midrod
passed through the smoke-stack and was rigidly attached to the frame at several
points, and a new pump and new boilers were substituted for those which had
been worn out. Aside from these changes, which although small, added very materially
to the general strength of the frame, no important changes were made
in No. 5 prior to its remarkable flight of May 6, 1896.</p>

<p>While these changes were being made in No. 5, similar ones were also being
carried out in New No. 4, and the addition of the rear wings to No. 4, together
with other slight changes, made it such a distinctively different machine from
what it had been, that it was now designated as No. 6. After making extensive <span class="xxpn" id="p079">[p079]</span>
repairs to the extremely light frame of No. 6 (formerly New No. 4) it was
thought to be in suitable condition for flight and was accordingly boxed preparatory
to sending it to Quantico.</p>

<p>The year, therefore, closed with No. 6 apparently in condition for test, but
it was decided not to take it to Quantico until No. 5, which was still undergoing
repairs, could also be got ready.</p>

<h4>1896</h4>

<p>A few days after the beginning of the new year, while the repairs on No. 5
were being completed, it was decided that the frame of No. 6 which had been
boxed ready to be carried into the field for trial, was so weak that before putting
it to an actual test in flight it would be best to make some tests on the strength
of its frame. While testing the frame for torsional strength, it broke under the
moderate test of a weight of 500 grammes placed at the tips of the wings, the
angle of deflection just prior to its breaking being 35°, while the frame of Old
No. 4 in March, 1895, had shown a deflection of only 10.5° under a similar test.
This breaking of the frame showed very plainly that the worst fears in regard
to it had been realized and that by some means or other the frame must be
strengthened. This was finally accomplished by making the midrod continuous
through the smoke-stack as had already been done in No. 5, and at the same
time an additional improvement was made in the means of attaching the Pénaud
tail, whereby it was lowered in order to give it a greater clearance in passing
under the launching car in actual test. Later the boilers proved defective and
new ones were substituted, but except for some minute details no further changes
were made in Aerodrome No. 6 prior to its test in May.</p>

<p>On May 6, No. 6 was unsuccessfully tried at Quantico just prior to the very
successful test of No. 5. In this test no serious damage was done to the frame,
but before going to Europe in the summer, Mr. Langley ordered that both aerodromes
be completely overhauled and put in condition for further experiments
in the fall. In this remodelling practically no changes were introduced in the
frame of either No. 5 or No. 6, but the engines of No. 6 were refitted and a new
boiler was substituted, which, with slight improvements in the burner, resulted
in a somewhat increased power in the engines.</p>

5 and 6, will be found in Chapter X <a href="#tocontents">◊</a>.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">I<span class="smmaj">NTRODUCTION</span></span></h4>

<p>In some early experiments in 1887 with the small models without motor
power, which have not been particularly described, two pairs of wings, in the
same plane, were employed for reasons connected with stability. Afterward,
in many of the rubber-driven motor models, which have been described in
Chapter II <a href="#tocontents">◊</a>, two large front wings were employed and the following pair were diminished
into what may properly be called a tail. This plan was a retrogression
in design, and it was pursued by the writer with a pertinacity which was
not justified by the results obtained, being used even on the early rubber-driven
models.</p>

<p>In this construction, it will be observed that the flat tail was in fact not
only a guiding but a sustaining surface, since it bore its own share of the
weight. It was not until a much later date (November, 1895) that the writer
returned to his earlier construction of two pairs of wings in the same plane
bearing the whole weight of the aerodrome, to which was now added a flat
tail, whose function was not to support, but wholly to guide. This was developed
into the final construction by the addition of a vertical rudder or
rudders.</p>

<p>The present chapter is not concerned with the history of the earlier attempts
with small models, or of those numerous constructions of sustaining surfaces
which were never put to actual trial; nor does it give any description of
the experiments which were made in placing one set of surfaces over the other,
according to a method suggested in “Experiments in Aerodynamics.”<a id="fnanchor_27" href="#footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></p>

<p>The experiments in “Aerodynamics,” and the theoretical considerations
given in Chapter V <a href="#tocontents">◊</a> on sustaining surfaces, would never alone have led to the
construction which was finally reached, which was largely due to the hard lessons
taught by incessant accident and failure in the field. The present chapter,
therefore, should be read in connection not only with the pages of “Aerodynamics,”
but with Chapters V and IX <a href="#tocontents">◊</a> of this book.</p>

<p>It is to be remembered that, while the center of gravity of the aerodrome
could be determined readily and exactly, the center of pressure could be determined
only approximately in advance of trial in actual flight. The positions <span class="xxpn" id="p081">[p081]</span>
of the supporting surfaces given in this chapter are, then, approximations made
from rules for “balancing,” <em class="italic">i. e.</em>, for obtaining equilibrium in actual flight,
rules which are in fact tentative, since they are founded on <em class="italic">a priori</em> considerations
with partial correction from the empirical knowledge gained by previous
field trials. For these rules see Chapter VI <a href="#tocontents">◊</a>.</p>

<h4>1893</h4>

<p>With reference to the supporting and guiding surfaces of Aerodromes Nos.
4, 5, and 6, Aerodrome No. 4, in its earliest condition mentioned in the preceding
chapter, was taken into the field, but never brought to trial in the air. It
is sufficient to say that in the largest of the three sets of wings constructed,
each wing was 17&#160;× 51 inches, and therefore contained about six square feet, so
that with the tail (which was at this time a supporting surface), whose area
was one-half that of the two wings, the total supporting surface was 18 square
feet, or since the flying weight was 9.1 pounds, the proportion of surface to
weight was somewhat less than 2 square feet to the pound. The wings were at
this time ribless, it being expected that the silk cover which was purposely left
loose would take its curve from the air filling it, which subsequent experience
has shown would have led to certain disaster if the aerodrome had been launched.
It may be added that there was a vertical rudder of what is now seen to have
been a wholly inadequate size. These remarks may be applied with little modification
to the attempted flight with No. 4 on May 25, except that the vertical
rudder had been made larger, but was still much too small.</p>

<h4>1894</h4>

<p>From the account of the field trials to be given in Chapter IX <a href="#tocontents">◊</a>, it will be
seen that in numerous attempts at flight prior to October 6, 1894, the cause of
failure can in every instance be traced to imperfections more fundamental than
those of the sustaining surfaces, either the launching device or some other
part failing to work satisfactorily. I therefore commence a description of the
sustaining surfaces with those of Nos. 4 and 5 as used on that day.</p>

<p>The construction of the wings of No. 4 and No. 5, which were nearly identical,
is shown in Fig. <em class="italic">A</em> Plate <a href="#plt016">16</a>. A rod of hickory, tapering from
<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">2</span></span>
inch in diameter
at the larger end to
<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">4</span></span>
inch at the smaller, was steamed and bent, as
shown in the drawing, to form the main front rib of the wing. This was
firmly clamped to the midrod, and to the rib in turn were attached a number
of cross-ribs of hickory, slightly curved, the inner one of which was fastened
to the hull at its inner extremity, while the whole was covered with silk. The
length of each wing was 162 cm. (63.75 inches), and the width 54 cm. (21.25
inches). The tail was plane and equal in area to one of the wings, so that the
joint area of the wings and tail was 2.62 square metres (28.2 sq. ft.).
<span class="xxpn" id="p082">[p082]</span></p>

<p>Each wing was attached to the midrod by a single clamp, different forms
of which are shown at <em class="italic">F</em>, <em class="italic">G</em>, <em class="italic">H</em>, <em class="italic">I</em> (Fig. 16).
The clamp consisted of two short
split tubes, into which the main front ribs were securely clamped by means of
screws. They were set at an angle and united to a grooved frame, by which
the wings could be readily attached to a second piece clamped about the midrod.
The tail clamp, like the wing clamp, was composed of two pieces, sliding
one upon the other, but as the tail formed a single surface, one part was permanently
attached to it. Clamps <em class="italic">F</em>, <em class="italic">G</em> were fitted to aerodrome No. 4, and <em class="italic">H</em>,
<em class="italic">I</em> to No. 5. The wings were set at a diedral angle of about 150°, but as they were
not guyed in any way, this angle in flight and under the upward pressure of the
air probably became much less. The tail was plane but ribbed like the wings.</p>

<div class="figc-s2">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">F<span class="smmaj">IG.</span></span>
16. Wing clamps, 1892–1896.</div>
</div>

<p>In preparing the machine for flight, the wings and tail of No. 4 were set
at a very small root angle with the midrod, perhaps not exceeding 3°, but while
this angle might be maintained at the firmly held root of the wing, it was later
seen to be probable that the extremity of the wing was flexed by the upward
pressure of the air after launching, though the full extent and evil effect of
this flexure was not recognized at the time. In the approximative calculations
for “balance,” made at this time, the tail was treated as bearing
<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">3</span></span>
of the weight
of the aerodrome, as it was
<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">3</span></span>
of the supporting area, for though it was recognized
that its position in the “lee” of the wings rendered it less efficient, the
degree of this diminution of efficiency was not realized. A vertical rudder
20 cm.&#160;× 70 cm. (8 in.&#160;× 28 in.), with an area of 0.14 metres (1.5 sq. ft.)
was used.
<span class="xxpn" id="p083">[p083]</span></p>

<p>The particulars of the launch will be found in Chapter IX <a href="#tocontents">◊</a>. In the present
connection, it is sufficient to say that though launched with the requisite velocity
and without accident, it fell into the water at a distance of about 15 metres
(49 feet) with the midrod nearly horizontal, the combined effect of engines and
initial impulse having in fact kept it in the air for less than two seconds. The
true cause of this failure not then being recognized, it was attributed to the
angle of the wings with the midrod having been too small.</p>

<p>The launch of No. 5 followed almost immediately, but taking warning by
the supposed cause of failure of No. 4, its wings were set at a root angle of 20°,
and a hurried adjustment was made to secure greater rigidity, the tip being
partly secured against twisting by a light cross-piece, and guyed so that the
wing as a whole was not only at a greater angle, but stiffer than in the case of
No. 4. These changes it was hoped would cause the aerodrome to advance at
a considerable initial angle with the horizontal, and it did so, for instantly after
the launch, as the aerodrome escaped from its bonds into free air, the inclination
of the midrod increased until it stood at about 60°, when the machine,
after struggling a moment to maintain itself, slid <em class="italic">backward</em> into the water
(with its engines working at full speed) after advancing about 12 metres (39
feet), and remaining in the air about 3 seconds.</p>

<p>On the whole, the result of the first actual trial of an aerodrome in the field
was disconcerting, for unless the result was due to the wings being placed in
a position wholly unfavorable to support, there seemed to be no doubt that
either the engine power or the supporting surface was insufficient. Now this
engine power was by computation between three and four times what was necessary
to support the aerodrome in horizontal flight at an angle of 20°, and
after making every allowance for slip, there should have been still an excess of
power for the first flight of No. 4, whereas actual trial indicated that it was
insufficient. But on the other hand, the experiment with No. 5, which momentarily
held its position in the air at an angle of 60°, seemed to indicate that the
engine power was abundant, and that the failure must be traced to some other
cause.</p>

<p>As a result of these experiments it was concluded, “that it is an all-important
thing that the angle of the front wing shall be correct, and that this
cannot be calculated unless it is known how much the tip will turn up under
pressure of the weight.” I felt, then, that I had learned something from the
failures as to the need of greater rigidity of the wings, though how to obtain
this without adding to their weight was a trying problem. It was thus at an
early stage suspected that the evil to be guarded against in wing construction
was the distortion of the form of the wing under pressure, chiefly by torsion,
which is specially hard to provide against without a construction which is <span class="xxpn" id="p084">[p084]</span>
necessarily heavy. This suspicion was a correct one, though the full extent of the
evil was not yet surmised.</p>

<p>In the light of subsequent experiment it may now be confidently stated that
the trouble was with the wings, which at the moment after launching were flexed
wholly out of the shape which they were designed to have, and which they retained
up to that critical moment.</p>

<p>After returning to Washington, one of the wings was inverted, and a quantity
of sand, equal in weight to the pressure upon the wing in flight, was added,
under which the yielding at the tip amounted to 65°, or from&#160;+20° to&#160;−45°,
showing that the wings were entirely too weak to sustain the aerodrome.</p>

<p>In speaking of the efforts to strengthen the wings, it must be constantly
remembered that this could hardly be done in any way which did not involve
increased weight; that is, it could hardly be done at all, since increased weight
was forbidden.</p>

<p>The first attempt at systematic guying was made on October 27. As shown
in Fig. <em class="italic">B</em>, Plate <a href="#plt016">16</a>, two guy-posts extending beneath the midrod were connected
by guy-wires with the outer extremities of the wing, by means of which
it was sought to hold the wing in place and prevent its extremity from twisting
upward, while a third wire connecting with the bowsprit prevented its moving
backward. In addition, two aluminum wires, stretched across above from
wing to wing, kept the lower guys tight.</p>

<p>On October 27, Aerodrome No. 5, equipped with large new wings and tail,
having a combined area of 3.7 square metres (40 sq. ft.), the wings being each
64 cm.&#160;× 192 cm. (25.25 in.&#160;× 75.75 in.), turned sharply and completely round, apparently
through some internal current of the main wind against which it was
advancing. Owing to this almost instantaneous turn, it lost headway and came
down. This led to the subsequent construction and use of a much larger vertical
rudder, intended to prevent in future any such sudden pivoting and consequent
loss of momentum. The wings showed a tendency to “pocket”<a id="fnanchor_28" href="#footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> and
bag, which indicated some serious fault in their construction.</p>

<p>As a result of these experiments, it was decided on October 29 to attempt
to make the wings stiffer (though their weight was almost prohibitory), by inserting
more cross-pieces, cross-pinning and guying them so as to make them
more rigid as a whole, and less liable to pocket.</p>

<p>At this time an automatic device in the form of a sliding tail was designed,
which it was thought would cause the center of pressure to move backward
when the aerodrome reared, and forward when it plunged downward, but the
device, though afterward constructed, was never brought to trial in the field.</p>

<p>Aerodrome No. 5, equipped with a new set of wings similar to those used <span class="xxpn" id="p085">[p085]</span>
on October 27, and guyed as in the previous experiment, was again launched
on November 21, with the results recorded in Chapter IX <a href="#tocontents">◊</a>. The failure was
attributed to the twisting of the wings under pressure to such an extent that
not only was their effective area greatly reduced, but the outer portions were
upturned so as to catch the air upon the upper surfaces, the result being in
part a downward pressure.</p>

<p>On the following day a pair of the wings was inverted and a weight of
sand equal to the air pressure to which they were subjected in flight, was distributed
over their surfaces. Under the action of this, the twisting of the wing
was seen to increase from the root, which was held with comparative rigidity,
up to the tip, where in spite of the cross-ribs it amounted to 45°. The resistance
to torsion lay chiefly in the front rib, which, in addition, could be bent
easily, allowing the surface to become distorted with great loss of lifting power.</p>

<p>The experiments of 1894 had demonstrated the urgent necessity for greater
rigidity in the sustaining surfaces, which might, as it seemed, be obtained either
by increasing the strength of the framing (which meant additional weight) or
by resorting to some new and untried construction, or by a proper system of
guying. Guying seemingly offered the most feasible solution of the problem;
but although the system of wire guying was thoroughly tried, the result was
very unsatisfactory, as the wings continued to twist and bag in a way that was
extremely discouraging.</p>

<h4>1895</h4>

<p>I accordingly had recourse in 1895 to the system of wooden guy-sticks
shown in Fig. <em class="italic">D</em>, Plate <a href="#plt016">16</a>, which necessarily added greatly to the weight of the sustaining
surfaces. Each wing was separately strengthened by means of a light
rod of spruce, in cross-section about the size of the main front rib, extending
across the upper surface of the wing, at a distance of about one-third the
width of the wing behind the front rib. It was tied to each of the cross-ribs
and to the outer bent portion of the front rib, and at its root was fastened to
the frame of the aerodrome.</p>

<p>This effectually prevented the bending of the front rib and the consequent
bagging of the cover, and to that extent marked a decided advance in wing
construction. But it was faulty, in that, not being supplemented by wire guying,
it offered little resistance to the twisting of the wing about the main front
rib, the rear tip of the wing being free to turn up under pressure, as it had
done on former occasions. A similar guy-stick was stretched across the tail. To
guard against torsion, rods extending diagonally across the wings and tail were
used, which, with the aid of the guy-sticks just described, prevented the surfaces
from twisting greatly. In addition, a rod joining the front ribs and stretching
across from wing to wing tended to maintain a fixed diedral angle.
<span class="xxpn" id="p086">[p086]</span></p>

<p>The wings as thus guyed were rigid enough, and in the field-trials of No. 5
on May 8 and June 6, did not yield noticeably under pressure, and there seemed
to be no serious default in their lifting power, but the guy-sticks were heavy
and the system was not again employed. The wings used in these trials, shown
in Fig. <em class="italic">C</em>, Plate <a href="#plt016">16</a>, had a frame of hickory, consisting of a front rib and nine cross-ribs,
over which the silk was tightly stretched. The curvature of the wings,
which is shown in the cross-sectional drawing, had a rise of about one-twelfth
the width, the highest point of curvature occurring about one-fourth the distance
from front to rear. Each wing was 64 cm.&#160;× 192 cm. (25.25 in.&#160;× 75.75 in.),
the two with the tail, in surface equal to a single wing, having an area of 3.7
square metres (40 sq. ft.). The combined weight of the wings was 1150 grammes
(2.53 pounds), and of the tail, 583 grammes (1.28 pounds).</p>

<p>The evolution of a vertical rudder had meanwhile been going steadily forward.
Those first used had been small, rectangular, stiff, and heavy, but in the
experiments of May 8 a much lighter and larger construction, consisting of a
frame 92 cm.&#160;× 76 cm. (36 in.&#160;× 30 in.) covered with paper, was used, and on June
7 this was replaced by a long, diamond-shaped rudder, having a spruce frame
covered with silk, very light and seemingly more effective than any hitherto
used.</p>

<p>I had in the meantime designed a “tail-rudder,” consisting of a horizontal
tail and vertical rudder combined, each having an area of about 0.6 square
metres (6.5 sq. ft.) which, however, was not used until 1896.</p>

<p>In August was begun the construction of a deeply curved and arched pair
of wings for No. 4, which consisted of a light framing of spruce elaborately
guyed and covered with gold-beater’s skin drawn tight as a drum-head with
pyroxelene varnish. In their construction a new feature, foreshadowed in the
method of guying the separate wings used in the field-trials of May and June,
was introduced, which was adopted in all subsequent constructions—the guy-stick,
previously described as stretching lengthwise across the wing being now
made a part of the wing itself, which was thus provided with two longitudinal
ribs instead of one. The additional rib occupied a central position, and like
the front rib was attached to the midrod by means of a strong wing clamp.
Its outer end was united to the front rib, which was here bent into a quadrant
of a circle. This pair of wings had an expanse of 435 cm. (14.3 feet), an area
of 2.5 square metres (26.8 sq. ft.), a weight of 660 grammes (1.45 pounds), and
a depth of curvature equal to one-tenth their width.</p>

<p>This construction offered a two-fold advantage in its resistance to both torsion
and bagging, for as the pressures upon the wing were nearly balanced
about the middle rib, the tendency to twist was reduced to a minimum, while
the bagging, which results from the bending of the framework, as distinct
from <span class="xxpn" id="p087">[p087]</span>
its twisting, was greatly reduced by the manner in which the frame was put
together, the whole construction permitting a return to the system of wire guying
at first adopted, which had been found inapplicable to a wing having but a
single longitudinal rib forming its front margin. When completed, the wings
were strongly guyed with piano wire, both above and below, to guy-posts attached
to the midrod, and each cross-rib was separately guyed with wire chords.
Although these wings had cost much in time and labor, and contained many
points of improvement, they were eventually found to be too weak to support
the aerodrome, and were therefore abandoned without a trial in the field.</p>

<p>For the plane horizontal tail hitherto used a pair of curved wings was substituted,
similar in all respects to those just described, but having only half
their area, and these were later replaced by a pair equal in size and in every
way the counterpart of the front wings. The tail as hitherto used accordingly
disappeared, and gave place to another having a wholly different function to
perform; for while the old tail, like the rear pair of wings which superseded
it, was intended to bear a definite part of the weight of the aerodrome, the new
tail which was now added behind the rear pair of wings was not supposed to
bear any part whatever of the weight, but to act solely as a guide, and this new
feature, first introduced in October, 1895, was continued to the end.</p>

<p>This arrangement of the surfaces is quite different from that adopted by
Pénaud in 1872, in which the tail became automatic in its action through its
small angle of elevation as compared with that of the wings, while still acting
as a supporting surface, whereas in the present arrangement the function of
the tail was solely one of guidance. This, I believe, was one of the important
changes which perhaps as much as any other led to final success.</p>

<p>During the fall of 1895 a large number of experiments were made both in
free flight with gliding models, and in constrained flight with the whirling-table,
to determine the relative lifting power of the front and rear wings per unit of
area, and from these the following new rules were deduced for finding the center
of pressure:</p>

<p>If a following wing is the size of the leader, assume that its efficiency is 66
per cent per unit of surface.</p>

<p>If it is half the size of the leader, assume that its efficiency is 50 per cent
per unit of surface.</p>

<p>If it is half as large again as the leader, assume that its efficiency is 80 per
cent per unit of surface.</p>

<p>For intermediate sizes of surface, proportionate values per unit of surface
may be assumed.</p>

<p>If we consider the area of the front wing to be unity, and that of the rear
wing to be <em class="italic">n</em>, and if <em class="italic">m</em> be the efficiency
of the rear wing per unit of surface, <span class="xxpn" id="p088">[p088]</span>
the above is expressed in the following formulæ, which it will be remembered
take account only of wings following each other in the same or nearly the same
plane, and are not applicable where one wing is either above or below the plane
of the other. In the formulæ, <em class="italic">CP</em> is the resultant center of pressure upon both
wings expressed in the notation described in Chapter II <a href="#tocontents">◊</a>, <em class="italic">CP</em><sub>fw</sub> is the center of
pressure of the front wings, and <em class="italic">CP</em><sub>rw</sub> the center of pressure of the rear wings.</p>

</div>

<p>The steady flight of one of the gliding models referred to led to the construction
of a new set of wings for No. 5, patterned after those used on the gliding
model. These wings, shown in Plate <a href="#plt017">17</a>, were rectangular in outline, 200
cm.&#160;× 80 cm. (6.56 ft.&#160;× 2.62 ft.), each wing having an area of 1.6 square metres
(17.1 sq. ft.) They were constructed with spruce framing covered with China
silk, and were strongly guyed with piano wire in much the same manner as the
light, skin-covered wings already described, which had preceded them. The combined
weight of the two pair was 1950 grammes (4.3 pounds).</p>

<p>The long central rib was now much the larger of the two which, as in the
preceding wing, formed the foundation of the structure. It occupied a position
two-fifths the distance from front to rear, and presumably coincided at all points
with the center of pressure of fore and aft sections of the wings, so that the pressure
in front of the rib was at all points balanced by the pressure in the rear,
and there was consequently little tendency in the wing to twist under pressure
of the wind. The two main ribs were rigidly connected by cross-ribs of spruce,
20 cm. (8 inches) apart, steamed and bent to the desired form. The curvature
of these ribs was the same for all, and in depth was one-twelfth the width of the
wing, while the highest point of curvature was one-sixth of the distance from
front to rear, these ratios having been chosen as approximating those found in
the wing of the soaring bird. These wings were subsequently used in the first
successful flights of the following year.</p>

AND SYSTEM OF GUYING <a class="linka" href="#listplates">◊</a></div>
</div>

<div class="xxpn" id="p089">[p089]</div>

<p>During the year 1895 but two field-trials were made with the steam aerodromes,
and neither of these was successful; but a great step forward had been
taken in the construction, guying and arrangement of the sustaining surfaces.
The wings had been made stronger with no increase in weight per unit of area.
On the contrary, the ratio of weight of sustaining surfaces to area had been actually
reduced from 43 to 28 grammes per square foot, so that the surfaces were
both lighter and stronger.</p>

<p>Two longitudinal ribs had taken the place of the single one before used, a
second wing clamp had been added to correspond to the midrib, the difficult
problem of torsion had been effectually solved, the system of guying greatly improved,
and it appeared that in the next trial the wings might be expected to
bear the weight of the aerodrome without serious distortion.</p>

<h4>1896</h4>

<p>In January, 1896, two new pairs of wings were designed for No. 6, and in order
to give a greater efficiency to the rear wings, they were made larger than
the front ones, the area of the latter being 22 square feet, and of the former 27
square feet, and whereas the width of each wing had formerly been one-third
of its length, it was now increased to two-fifths to correspond to those of No. 5.</p>

<p>The progress made in construction and guying is shown by the fact that
when on January 28 one pair of the wings of No. 5 was inverted and sanded, the
yielding at the tip was less than 5° greater than at the root, whereas at one time
it had been 65°. A similar test applied to a pair of wings of No. 6 on March 4
gave even better results, as the yield at the root was but 1° 45′, and at the tip
2° 30′.</p>

<p>The successive stages of the development of the wing clamps are shown in
Fig. 16. In its final form the front wing clamp, or that which held the main
front rib, shown at <em class="italic">AB</em> (1896), had adjustable sliding pieces, by means of which
the wings could be set at any desired angle of elevation, the wing as a whole revolving
about the rear wing clamp, shown at <em class="italic">CD</em> (1896).</p>

<p>The general system of guying the wings, as shown in Plate <a href="#plt017">17</a>, had been
greatly improved. In the present form a bowsprit and guy-posts firmly attached
to the midrod furnished points of attachment for the piano wires with
which the wings were guyed and held rigidly in place, other wires being stretched
across from wing to wing so as to maintain them at a constant diedral angle of
about 150°. The clamps by which the guy-posts were attached to the midrod, are
shown at <em class="italic">EF</em> (Fig. 16).</p>

<p>In the successful flights of No. 5 on May 6, the completed wings already described
weighed together 1950 grammes (4.29 pounds), and had a total sustaining
area of 6.4 square metres (68.8 square feet), the flying weight of the <span class="xxpn" id="p090">[p090]</span>
aerodrome was 11,775 grammes (26 pounds), and the sustaining surfaces therefore
amounted to 2.6 square feet to the pound, which, as the event proved, was amply
sufficient.</p>

<p>The “tail-rudder,” shown in Plate <a href="#plt017">17</a>, comprised a vertical and horizontal
surface of silk intersecting in a central rod or axis, having a length of 115 cm.
(3.8 feet). The framing was of spruce and consisted of two sets of four arms,
each radiating from the central rod, the hexagonal outline of the surfaces being
formed of piano wire, over which the silk was drawn and sewed. The area
of each surface was about 0.6 square metres (6.45 square feet), and the total
weight was 371 grammes (0.8 pounds).</p>

<p>A flat steel spring inserted in the forward end between the rudder and the
midrod gave it a certain desirable degree of elasticity in a vertical direction.
The rudder was held in place by a pin passing through the midrod, and was so
set as to coincide with the line of direct flight, its purpose, as already explained,
being to guide the aerodrome, but to take no part in its sustention.</p>

<p>In balancing Aerodrome No. 5 on May 6, the wings were so adjusted that in
accordance with the notation given above, p. <a href="#p015">15</a>:</p>

<div class="equationbox"><div class="inlineblk">
<div class="left"><em class="italic">CP</em><sub>fw</sub>&#160;= 1575</div>
<div class="left"><em class="italic">CP</em><sub>rw</sub>&#160;= 1415.5;</div>

</div>

<p class="continue">The center of gravity was located at 1497, so that there should have been a very
slight tendency on the part of the aerodrome to rise, as was actually the case.
The formula was perhaps not quite so accurate as the prolonged flight of the
aerodrome would seem to indicate, as it takes no account of the thrust of the
propellers, which in action tended to elevate the aerodrome in front while their
resistance would tend to depress it when they had ceased to revolve, which consideration
accounts for the action of the aerodrome on May 6, as described in
Chapter IX <a href="#tocontents">◊</a>. The formula may, however, be regarded as approximately correct.</p>

<p>In the final successful trial with No. 6 on November 28, 1896, the wings used
were similar in general construction and manner of guying to those of No. 5 on
May 6, but, as shown in the photograph (Plate <a href="#plt029a">29A</a>, Chapter X), the front rib at
its outer extremity was bent to a quadrant to connect with the midrib, this construction
being somewhat stronger than that adopted in the wings of No. 5. The
curvature was but one-eighteenth of the width of the wing instead of one-twelfth
as in No. 5. The front and rear pairs were similar and equal and had a combined
area of 5 square metres (54 sq. ft.), and a weight of 2154 grammes <span class="xxpn" id="p091">[p091]</span>
(4.74 lbs.). The flying weight of the aerodrome was 12,120 grammes (26.7 lbs.), the
sustaining surface thus amounting to slightly more than 2 square feet to the
pound.</p>

<p>The position of the wings, in accordance with the notation adopted, was</p>

<div class="equationbox"><div class="inlineblk">
<div class="left"><em class="italic">CP</em><sub>fw</sub>&#160;= 1563.2,</div>
<div class="left"><em class="italic">CP</em><sub>rw</sub>&#160;= 1374.</div>

</div>

<p class="continue">The center of gravity was located at 1484, which was 3.5 cm. in the rear of the
center of pressure. The flight was approximately horizontal, and the setting
seems to have been as accurate as could be desired. The angle of elevation of
the wings at the root was 10° 30′, and so well were they guyed that there was no
visible yielding at any point during the flight. As the midrod during flight was
approximately horizontal the angle of elevation of the wings may be taken as
10° 30′; the efficiency of the rear wings was two-thirds that of the front wings,
and the effective area was therefore
<span class="mixfract">27+27×<span class="fract"><span class="fup">2</span><span
 class="fdn">3</span></span></span>&#160;= 45 square feet.</p>

<p>The wings being very nearly plane we have therefore the data for determining
the soaring speed from the formula of “Aerodynamics” (Chapter VI,
p. 60).</p>

<p>The speed actually attained, however, was about 30 miles an hour, or 44
feet per second, which seems to indicate that the angle of elevation under pressure
was reduced to much less than 10° 30′. For a velocity of 44 feet per second,
the theoretical value of α would be but 6°. In this calculation, however, the hull
resistance and that of the system of guy-wires, which must have been comparatively
large, has been omitted. It would appear, therefore, that the actual results
obtainable in flight are much more favorable than calculations based on
experimental data would presuppose.</p>

HISTORY OF LAUNCHING APPARATUS AND FIELD-TRIALS OF
AERODROMES 4, 5 AND 6</h3></div>

<h4><span class="smcap">L<span class="smmaj">AUNCHING</span></span>
<span class="smcap">A<span class="smmaj">PPARATUS</span></span></h4>

<p>I have elsewhere mentioned that the difficulties of launching even a very
small model aerodrome are considerable. Early experiments were tried with
an apparatus something like a gigantic cross-bow, and in later years with various
forms of pendulum, all of which latter brought out the inherent theoretical
defect of the movement of rotation of the aerodrome, and were otherwise practically
inefficient.</p>

<p>A device, consisting of two pendulums, one behind the other, connected by a
rigid rod, from which the aerodrome could be suspended and cast off without rotation,
was at one time considered, but abandoned. Experiments were also made
with several forms of railroad, upon which the aerodrome was to run up to the
moment of release, before the form of launching apparatus, which finally proved
successful, was adopted.</p>

<p>All these had failed chiefly for two reasons; first, it was difficult to cause
the aerodrome to be released just at the moment it attained sufficient speed to
soar; second, the extensive surface presented to the wind by the wings of the
aerodrome, made it necessary to provide means for holding the machine securely
at several points up to the moment of release without danger of interfering
in any way with the aerodrome when it was cast into the air. This proved
a serious problem, which can be appreciated only by one who has seen such a
machine in the open air, where its wings are subject to movement and distortion
by the slightest breeze. The steps by which these difficulties were removed
and the final type of launching apparatus perfected are recorded in the following
pages in connection with the field-trials of the model aerodromes.</p>

<h4>1892</h4>

<p>As the end of the year 1892 approached and with it the completion of an
aerodrome of large size which had to be started upon its flight in some way,
the method and place of launching it pressed for decision. One thing at least
seemed clear. In the present stage of experiment, it was desirable that the aerodrome
should-—if it must fall-—fall into water where it would suffer little injury
and be readily recovered, rather than anywhere on land, where it would
almost certainly be badly damaged.
<span class="xxpn" id="p093">[p093]</span></p>

<p>The shores of the Potomac on both banks were scrutinized for this purpose,
from a point about two miles above Washington to below Chopawamsic
Island, some thirty miles below the city. Several lofty and secluded positions
were found, but in all these there was the danger that the aerodrome might be
wrecked before reaching the water, or, turning in its course, fly inland; but more
than this, it could be launched only on the rare occasions when the exact wind
was blowing which the local conditions demanded.</p>

<p>Finally, the idea, which seems obvious enough when stated, presented itself
of building a kind of house-boat, not to get up initial motion by the boat’s
own velocity, but to furnish an elevated platform, which could be placed in the
midst of a considerable expanse of water, if desired, under conditions which
admitted of turning in the direction of the wind, as it need hardly be repeated
that it was indispensable to the machine, as it is to the bird, to rise in the face
of a wind, if there be any wind at all.</p>

<p>The house-boat in question was nothing more than a scow about 30 feet long
by 12 feet wide, upon which a small house was erected, to be used for the occasional
storing of the aerodromes. On account of the accidents which were certain
to occur in the first attempts, it was fitted up with the means of making
small repairs. On the roof of the house there was a platform upon which the
operator stood when making a launch, and upon which were mounted the launching
devices hereafter described.</p>

<p>This boat, shown in Plate <a href="#plt018">18</a>, was completed in November, 1892.</p>

<h4>1893</h4>

<p>By the kindness of the Superintendent of the Coast Survey, the house-boat
was towed in May, 1893, down to Chopawamsic Island, a small island near the
western bank of the Potomac River, not far from the Quantico station of the
Washington and Richmond Railroad Company. A map of the island and the adjacent
land and water is shown in Plate <a href="#plt019">19</a>.</p>

<p>The house-boat was at all times moored somewhere on the west side of the
island, in the stretch of quiet water between that and the west shore of the river.
The waters shown here are, with the exception of a narrow channel, very shallow,
and, indeed, partly dry at low tide, so that there was no danger of an aerodrome
being lost, unless its flight carried it a long distance away and over the land.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">F<span class="smmaj">IELD</span></span>
<span class="smcap">T<span class="smmaj">RIALS</span></span><a id="fnanchor_29" href="#footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a>
</h4>

<p>Aerodrome No. 4, as shown in Plate <a href="#plt011">11</a>, had a single midrod, a flying weight
of 9 pounds,<a id="fnanchor_30" href="#footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> and supporting surface, consisting of wings and tail, of
18 square
feet. <span class="xxpn" id="p094">[p094]</span> Its engines, with about 100 pounds pressure, developed an aggregate of
0.4 H. P., and lifted 50 per cent of the flying weight. The propellers were 60 cm.
(2 feet) in diameter and
<span class="mixfract">1<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">4</span></span></span>
pitch ratio.</p>

<p>The aerodrome was intended to be launched by a contrivance called the
“starter,” which was an inclined rod, hinged at the bottom, on the top of which
the aerodrome was supported on a rod which was thrown down at the instant
of flight, giving the aerodrome a slight forward impulse, with the expectation
that it would get up sufficient initial speed to soar from the action of its
propellers.</p>

<p>On November 18 the writer (L), with Dr. Barus (B) and the two mechanics
(R and M), went to Quantico by an early train, and superintended with interested
expectation the arrangements for this first trial in the open air of the mechanism
which had now been over two years in preparation.</p>

<p>We met with an unexpected difficulty—that of launching the aerodrome at
all, for though the wind was only a very gentle breeze, it was only by holding
it down with the hands that it was possible to keep the aerodrome in position
for the launch, during the few minutes which passed from the time it was placed
upon the apparatus to the time of releasing it. Whether the launching device
itself might be effective or not could not be ascertained, since it was found that
nothing which could even be called an attempt to launch could be made except
in an absolute calm; a condition of things very difficult for any one to understand
who has not passed through the experience. The writer returned to Washington
at the close of the day without having done anything, but having learned
a great deal.</p>

<p>November 20. L, with B and M, came down again, and waited until 4.20,
when, the breeze having fallen to almost a calm, the aerodrome was maintained
in place on the launching apparatus with great difficulty, while it was repeatedly
set on fire by the scattering liquid fuel. Finally it was let go, and fell close
to the house-boat, the tail striking the edge of the platform. The immediate
cause of failure was the defective launching apparatus, for the design of which
the writer felt himself responsible.</p>

<p>November 24. L, with B, M, and R came down again to Quantico, but the
very moderate wind proved completely prohibitory to any attempt at launching,
and all returned again to Washington.</p>

<p>November 27. L, with B and M, came down to try a new launching apparatus,
not different in principle from the preceding one, but of better construction.
The morning was exceptionally calm, but the engines were found to be
out of order, and precious time was spent in slight repairs which should have
been made in the shop. At 3.30 p. m., when the engines were at last ready, the
exceptional calm gave place to a very gentle and almost imperceptible breeze, <span class="xxpn" id="p095">[p095]</span>
which, nevertheless, again proved prohibitory to the launching, and with extreme
disappointment the party returned to Washington, it being at last fully
recognized that unless some ways were found of holding down all the extended
supporting surfaces upon the launching piece, and at the same time of firmly
clamping the body of the aerodrome until it could be dropped, as well as of releasing
all this simultaneously at the critical instant, no attempt at launching
was likely to succeed except in such an entire and perfect calm as rarely occurs.
Independent of this launching difficulty, some way of protecting the fires from
the wind had to be found, which was by no means easy, since an efficient protection
meant an enclosure of them and a diminished influx of air, of which it
was essential that there should be an unlimited supply.</p>

<p>December 1. L, with B, R, and M proceeded to Quantico. The same conditions
presented themselves and the party returned, without effecting anything.</p>

<p>December 7. L, B, R, and M present; day overcast but perfectly calm.
Taught by experience, we had everything ready, and a little after one o’clock the
launch was made. The aerodrome fell directly into the boat, the rod of the
starter having broken. It was little damaged, but in view of the injury and
the rising wind, all other attempts were abandoned for the day.</p>

<p>December 11. Present, L, with B, R, and M. A new “starter” had been
devised and brought down, but was not yet quite ready for use, and an attempt
was made to employ the old one with the improvements suggested by experience,
but, after two attempts to launch, the work was abandoned for the day, owing
this time not to the launching apparatus, but to troubles in the engines and
pumps, due probably to injuries received in the fall of the 7th, which were not
detected until the time of the actual trial.</p>

<p>December 20. L, with B, M, and G, present; engine and aerodrome in order
and everything apparently favorable. What seemed to be an almost entire
calm came toward evening, yet once more the all but imperceptible breeze which
prevailed was found to defeat all arrangements for holding the aerodrome to
the launching ways before it was let go.</p>

<p>Trips to Quantico were also made on November 24, and December 1 and 21,
of which no account is given as the very moderate wind which prevailed in each
case precluded any attempt at launching the aerodrome.</p>

<p>It will be seen that eight trips were made to Quantico, and that, far from
any flight having been made, not once even was the aerodrome launched at all.
The principal cause for this lay in the unrecognized amount of difficulty introduced
by the very smallest wind, irrespective of the unfitness of the launching
apparatus to give the desired initial speed and direction.</p>

<p>In all these trials, the aerodrome rested on the launching apparatus, by
which it was projected forward by means of a spring in such a way as not to
interfere with the propellers.
<span class="xxpn" id="p096">[p096]</span></p>

<p>Previous tests with the rubber-driven models had demonstrated the futility
of all simple pendulum types of “cast off,” and likewise all the trials hitherto
of a railroad form of launching apparatus, in which the aerodrome was mounted
on a car, which had itself to get out of the way, were equally failures, so that
when the device referred to above proved to be worthless, it seemed that almost
every plan had been exhausted. There were, moreover, other difficulties, some
of which have been indicated above, such as that of making the burners work
properly in even a moderate wind during the very short time required for attaching
the wings and so adjusting the aerodrome on the launching apparatus.</p>

<p>These difficulties, which, now that they have been overcome, seem difficulties
no longer, but which then seemed insuperable, were all connected with the
ever-present problem of weight. It would have been easy to make rigid sustaining
surfaces which would not bend in the wind; to make fires which would not go
out; and easy to overcome all the impediments which seem so trivial in description
and were so formidable in practice, were it not that the mandate of absolute
necessity forbade this being done by any contrivance which would add to
the weight of an already phenomenally light construction. The difficulties of the
flight as they were seen in the workshop were multiplied, then, beyond measure
by the actual experiments in the field, and the year closed with a most discouraging
outlook.</p>

<h4>1894</h4>

<p>The new year began without any essential improvement in the means already
described, though a new launching apparatus had been devised by the
writer, which was scarcely so much an apparatus for launching, in the ordinary
sense of the word, as one of holding the aerodrome out over the water, and
simply letting it drop from a height of about 25 feet, during which fall it was
hoped (exact data being unobtainable in advance of experiment) that there
would be time for the propellers to give the aerodrome the necessary soaring
speed before reaching the water. This device consisted of an inverted tripod,
which held the aerodrome comparatively steady by three bearing points, while
a cross-bar of wood was added to prevent the wings from swaying before the
launch. Previously, the supporting surfaces, wings and tail, had been put on
only at the last minute. Now it became possible to keep them on in a gentle
breeze for an indefinite time before launching.</p>

<p>January 9. The previous day having been spent in practicing the steps preliminary
to launching, so as to avoid delay in assembling and mounting the aerodrome,
the writer, with Dr. Graham Bell, went to Quantico. The day was calm,
and every condition seemed favorable. The aerodrome was dropped fairly, under
full steam, and it fell in a nearly horizontal position, but touched the water
at a distance of only 50 or 60 feet, evidently before the necessary
initial speed <span class="xxpn" id="p097">[p097]</span>
could be impressed on it by its engines. The conclusion should have been that
by this method nothing but a practically unsuitable height would suffice to start
the aerodrome in a calm, though it might perhaps be done in the face of a considerable
breeze.</p>

<p>May 25. After a considerable interval of delay, due to the river being closed
by ice and other causes, Aerodrome No. 4 was again dropped from the starter
under nearly the same conditions as in the trial of January 9, and with a quite
similar result, the final conclusion being that this method must be abandoned.
It may be added that a vertical rudder was tried on this day.</p>

<p>June 12. No. 4, with an improved blast, was tried at Quantico, Mr. Goode
being present. The day ended in failure from another cause, the improved
blast, which worked well in the shelter of the shop, but proved useless in the field,
being extinguished by the feeblest wind. At this time (in June and July) I designed
a horizontal railroad with launching springs and track, underneath which
ran a car which held the aerodrome firmly until the moment of automatic release.
This apparatus finally proved to be the successful solution of the launching
problem. The description given later, with the drawing in Plate <a href="#plt018">18</a>, shows the
after-improvements, but no specific change from that in use from the first.</p>

<p>About this time I also arranged for certain changes in the boilers and
burners, having decided that I would not go into the field without some ground
for confidence not only that the aerodrome could be launched successfully, but
that a steady flame could be maintained under the boilers.</p>

<p>October 6. No. 4, as remodelled, having a flying weight of about 14.5 pounds,
a supporting surface of about 28 square feet, with a total engine power of about
0.5 H. P., and having lifted 40 per cent of its weight on the pendulum, was taken
down the river for trial with the new railroad launching apparatus, and several
days were spent in erecting the launching apparatus on the house-boat, and in
launching “dummy” aerodromes from it for practice.</p>

<p>Aerodrome No. 4 then being fitted under conditions which apparently insured
a good start (the center of pressure being nearly over the center of gravity,
the root angle of the wing being zero, the midrod nearly horizontal, the
engine working well, and with apparently ample sustaining surface) was finally
successfully launched, but the hopes which were reasonably entertained proved
to be unfounded. The result of this first actual trial of a “flying machine” in
free air was most disconcerting, for the aerodrome, which had <em class="italic">in theory</em> many
times the power required for horizontal flight, plunged into the water with its
engines working at full speed, after a course hardly longer than that performed
by the dummy. This result was at first inexplicable.</p>

<p>No. 4, then, did not fly at all, from some at first inscrutable cause, and it was
decided to make a trial of No. 5, though it was hard to put the result of so much <span class="xxpn" id="p098">[p098]</span>
time, painstaking and cost to the hazard of destruction. With the experience
just acquired from the trial of No. 4, the wing of No. 5 was set at an angle of
about 20° with the midrod, and the tip was secured by a light cross-piece, so
guyed that the wing as a whole, while set at this considerably greater angle with
the rod, was stiffer than before. In addition to this, the air chamber was moved
back so that the center of gravity was from 6 to 10 cm. behind the (calculated)
center of pressure. These changes were made in order to insure that the front
should at any rate keep up, and it did.</p>

<p>The aerodrome was launched successfully with the engines working under
a pressure of 110 pounds of steam. The head rose continually until the mid-rod
stood up at an angle of about 60°, checking all further advance. It remained
in the air in a stationary position for nearly a second, and then slid <em class="italic">backward</em>
into the water, striking on the end of the rudder and bending it. The distance
flown was about 12 metres, and the time of flight 3 seconds. One of the
propellers was broken short off, and the shaft was bent.</p>

<p>It thus became clearly evident that some cause prevented the proper balancing
of the machine, which was necessary to secure even approximately the theoretically
simple condition of horizontal flight. It was all-important that the
angle of the front wing should be correct, but its position could not be accurately
known in advance of experiment, and this experiment could only be made with
the machine itself, and involved the risk of wrecking it.</p>

<p>These trials gave a very vivid object lesson of what had already been anticipated,<a id="fnanchor_31" href="#footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a>
that the difficulties of actual flight would probably lie even more in obtaining
exact balance than in the first and more obvious difficulty of obtaining
the mere engine power to sustain a machine in the air. The immediate problem
was to account for the totally different behavior of the two aerodromes in the
two flights, under not very different conditions.</p>

<p>Observations of the movement of the two aerodromes through the air, as
seen by the writer from the shore, seemed to show, however, that the wings
did not remain in their original form, but that at the moment of launching there
was a sudden flexure and distortion due to the upward pressure of the air. The
time of flight was too short, and the speed too great, to be sure of just what did
occur, but it seemed probable that the wings flexed under the initial pressure of
the weight which came upon them at the moment of launching, and that they
were in fact, while in the air, a wholly different thing from what they were an
instant before, so that a very slight initial difference in the angle at which they
first met the air might cause the air to strike in the one case on the top of the
wings and throw the head down, and in the other case so as to throw the head up.
To ascertain the extent and character of this flexure, caused, it will be observed, by <span class="xxpn" id="p099">[p099]</span>
the <em class="italic">weight</em> of the aerodrome suddenly thrown on the wings, I inverted the aerodrome
and distributed a weight of dry sand equal to that of the whole machine
evenly over the supporting surfaces. It was found that under the weight of the
sand the extremity of the wings bent to an angle of 45° downwards (and consequently
must have bent to an angle of 45° upwards in the air), a condition of
affairs worse than anything that had been suspected, and seeming to demand
the entire reconstruction of the wings with a strength and consequent weight
for which there was no means of providing.</p>

<p>There had been some injuries to the machines in the trials of the 5th and
6th, and these were repaired. A new float had been made for No. 4, and a new
set of larger wings for No. 5. Each of these wings had a length of 76 inches
and a breadth of 25 inches, making the total surface of the two 26.4 sq. ft., while
that of the tail was 13.2 sq. ft., or about 40 sq. ft. in all.</p>

<p>October 22. When No. 5 was finally prepared for another trial, its condition
was as follows:</p>

<p>October 25. The aerodromes having been taken to Quantico on October 23,
and satisfactory experiments made with dummies in order to test the launching
apparatus, the house-boat was carried out into midstream and moored.</p>

<p>Aerodrome No. 4 was launched in the face of a wind of about 1100 feet per
minute. The midrod was at a very small inclination with the horizontal, about
3°. The angle (α) of the chord of the curved wing measured at the rod, where
it was rigidly held, was 15°. The adjustment was such as to bring the <em class="italic">CG</em> immediately
under the <em class="italic">CP</em>, without any allowance for the fact that the line of propeller
thrust was below the <em class="italic">CP</em>.<a id="fnanchor_34" href="#footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> The aerodrome under these conditions was
launched with the head high. It made a real, though brief, flight of about 130
feet in
<span class="mixfract">4<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">2</span></span></span>
seconds, when it swung abruptly round through 90°, and, losing headway,
sank continuously, finally falling backward into the water.</p>

<p>October 27. Aerodrome No. 4, having been repaired and guyed with wires
from the wings to vertical guy-posts beneath, was launched again,
but one of the <span class="xxpn" id="p100">[p100]</span>
guy-wires caught on the launching car, and threw the aerodrome immediately
into the water with but little damage.</p>

<p>On the same day No. 5 was launched. The theoretical <em class="italic">CP</em>−<em class="italic">CG</em> was nominally
0, but, for the reasons stated in the footnote on p. 99, was really something
positive, that is to say, the <em class="italic">CP</em> was really somewhat
in advance of the <em class="italic-padr">CG</em>; inclination
of midrod less than α (=20°). The aerodrome under these circumstances,
while keeping its head up, at first fell rapidly, yet seemed about to rise
just as it struck the water, conveying the idea that if the launching had been
made with a greater initial velocity it would have risen and cleared the water.
The wings visibly pocketed, however, and it was clear that some better disposition
must still be made for them. The flight was
<span class="mixfract">3<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">2</span></span></span>
seconds.</p>

<p>No. 5 was tried again on the same day with larger wings, whose area was 40
square feet. These wings, though stiffer, pocketed a little, α=20° as before. It
flew rapidly, and at first horizontally, to a distance of 100 feet or more against
a five-mile breeze. It then turned abruptly round through 180°, at first falling
(from loss of headway), then distinctly rising, and at the same time throwing
its head up until it reached an angle of nearly 60° with the vertical, when it fell
backward after a flight of between 6 and 7 seconds. The wings were evidently
not yet strong enough to resist flexure.</p>

<p>November 21. No. 5, in nearly the same condition as before. Two extra
springs had been placed on the launching car, in order to give the aerodrome a
greater initial velocity than before. Everything appeared favorable, but as it
left the launching track a piece flew out of the port propeller, in spite of which
the aerodrome, after dropping 5 feet, rose bodily at an angle of 45° and fell
backward into the water (time, 5 seconds).</p>

<p>Another trial was made the same day with the same aerodrome, under similar
conditions, except that the angle of inclination (α) was reduced to 7°. It
now, with all the other circumstances of launching like those immediately before,
behaved entirely differently, plunging head downward into the water at
a distance of 30 feet. Once more it was shown beyond dispute that the wings
must somehow be made even stiffer.</p>

<p>December 8. Another trial was undertaken with No. 5, the <em class="italic">CG</em> being 10 cm.
in front of the <em class="italic">CP</em> at rest. The root angle of the wings was 18°, tip angle 27°,
elevation of midrod 1 in 24. The other changes made since the previous trial
consisted chiefly in the increased weight due to the longer and stronger frames
and shafts that were made to carry 100 cm. propellers. The flight obtained was
so short that it was as unsatisfactory as before.</p>

<p>The aerodrome rose in the air after leaving the launching apparatus, and
then slid back into the water in the plane of its own wings. On the first trial, it
struck the boat, and was slightly injured; on the second, with root angle of <span class="xxpn" id="p101">[p101]</span>
wings 10°, tip angle 20°, the flight partook of the same character, but the machine
struck the water clear of the boat.</p>

<p>The fact that with the <em class="italic">CG</em> 10 cm. in advance of the calculated <em class="italic">CP</em> the aerodrome
steadily rose in front, seems to indicate that the rule used at that time for
calculating the <em class="italic">CP</em> (see Chapter II <a href="#tocontents">◊</a>) was not very accurate. This rule was based
upon the assumption that the tail, having an area equal to one-third the entire
sustaining surface, supported one-third the total weight (expressed by the formula
<span class="inlineblk"><em class="italic">CP</em>&#160;=
<span class="fract"><span class="fup">2<em class="italic">CP</em><sub>wm</sub>&#160;+ <em class="italic">CP</em><sub>tm</sub></span><span class="fdn">3</span></span>,</span>
where <em class="italic">CP</em><sub>wm</sub>
and <em class="italic">CP</em><sub>tm</sub> represent respectively the <em class="italic">CP</em>
of the wings and tail in motion), and that the <em class="italic">CP</em> of each surface was one-fifth
its width in front of the center of figure.</p>

<p>December 12. Four days later, the tail had been moved back 21 cm., thus
carrying the <em class="italic">CG</em> back 7 cm., but the vertical rudder (weighing 105 grammes),
for which there was now no room, was taken off, which in a measure counteracted
this change.</p>

<p>A trial was then made with the wings set at an initial angle of 8° at the
root and 20° at the tip. The aerodrome was released with the engines working
under a steam pressure of 90 pounds, and soared off horizontally for some distance,
when suddenly it swerved to the right as though something on that side
had given out, and turning quite through 180° headed toward the boat, striking
the water about 76 feet away. The time of the flight was 4 seconds.</p>

<p>It was found upon the recovery of the machine that one of the propellers
had been twisted through 90°, so that the two were no longer symmetrical. The
turning may have been due to this twist or to unequal influence of the wind
upon the two wings; for when I applied the sand test to the wings after returning
them to Washington, it was found that they deflected so much that the grains
would not lie upon them, which, to a great extent, explains the failure to secure
a better flight.</p>

<p>Thus the end of another year had been reached, and what might be called a
real flight had not yet been secured. The only progress that seemed to have been
made was that the aerodromes were not quite so unmanageable and erratic in
their flights as at the beginning of the year, and that it had been demonstrated,
at least to the writer’s satisfaction, that the power was sufficient for the work to
be done. The launching device had been so perfected that it worked satisfactorily,
but the problem of balancing seemed as far from solution as before.</p>

<h4>1895</h4>

<p>While, for convenience in narrating the progress of the work with the aerodromes,
each year has been treated as a unit, it is, of course, understood that
the work itself shows no especial difference between the closing of one year and
the beginning of another. Changes which had important effects were introduced <span class="xxpn" id="p102">[p102]</span>
at various times, but were, of course, made as they suggested themselves without
any reference to time or season. But while it was customary to make, from
time to time, a résumé of the progress of the work, yet at the closing of the calendar
year it was the custom to make a more complete digest of just what had
been accomplished during the year.</p>

<p>Upon thus reviewing the progress of the work during 1894, it was felt that
the results which had been accomplished for such a large expenditure of time
seemed small, since no real flight had been made by any of the aerodromes, and
no definite assurance that a successful flight would be obtained within the immediate
future seemed warranted by what had already been accomplished. But
now that the principal difficulties connected with the launching apparatus had
been overcome, thus permitting the aerodromes themselves to be given a fair
trial, the belief was encouraged that the continuance of the actual tests of the
machines, with slight changes which previous tests had shown advisable, would
finally result in a successful flight.</p>

<p>The early weeks of 1895 were spent in a series of pendulum tests on No. 5,
and in making such slight changes as these tests indicated would be advisable.
As a result of small improvements introduced in the boilers, No. 5 had by the
middle of March shown a repeated lift of considerably over 50 per cent, and in
some tests as much as 62 per cent of its flying weight. Certain radical changes
previously described in Chapter VII <a href="#tocontents">◊</a> were also made in Aerodrome No. 4, and
in the pendulum tests of it a lift of 44 per cent of its flying weight had been
obtained.</p>

<p>Encouraged by the better results which the aerodromes had shown in the
above tests, it was decided to test them again in free flight,
and they were accordingly
sent down to Quantico in charge of the two mechanics, R and M, Mr.
Langley, accompanied by Dr. Graham Bell, whom he had invited to witness the
tests, following on May 8. On the evening of May 8 No. 5 was mounted on the
launching apparatus in order to drill the mechanics so that when favorable
weather presented itself the aerodrome could be got ready for launching with the
minimum delay.</p>

<p>On May 9 Mr. Langley and Dr. Bell reached the house-boat at 5 a. m., but
even with the drill of the previous evening the mechanics were not able to have
No. 5 ready for trial until 6.15 a. m. The principal conditions of No. 5 at this
time were:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Total weight 11,200 grammes (24.6 pounds), including 800 grammes of
fuel and water. Previous lift on the pendulum 54 per cent, with a steam pressure
of 150 pounds. With this steam pressure the engine made about 600
R. P. M. when driving the 95 cm. propellers, which through their reduction
gearing made about 500 R. P. M.
<span class="xxpn" id="p103">[p103]</span></p></div>

<p>When the aerodrome was balanced for flight so as to bring the theoretical
“center of pressure in motion” over the center of gravity, it was found that it
was not possible to carry the center of gravity in front of this point, although
it was known by experience to be necessary. Accordingly in the first trial the
outer ends of the tail were pressed down by the guys so that the wind of advance
tended to lift the tail and throw the head down more than if the tail had
been flat. Furthermore, the float, weighing 200 grammes, instead of being placed
in its normal position near the base of the bowsprit, was carried out to its extremity,
this change in the position of the float alone being sufficient to carry the
center of gravity forward three or four centimetres. The curved wings were
set at an angle of nine degrees at the root and eleven degrees at the tip. They
were well guyed, and in flight appeared to be not materially twisted or altered.</p>

<p>It was anticipated that the pressing down of the outer ends of the tail and the
shifting of the center of gravity would cause the aerodrome to point downward in
flight, and this anticipation was verified in the test. At 6.15 a. m. the aerodrome
was launched at a steam pressure of 120 pounds. A perfect calm prevailed at
the time and the machine started straight ahead. There was no perceptible
drop at the moment it was released from the launching car, but a smooth and
steady descent until it struck the water, nose down, at a point approximately
200 feet from the boat. Dr. Bell noted that the length of time the aerodrome
was in the air was 2.8 seconds. One of the propellers was broken and the other
one was found to have twisted its shaft one-fourth of a turn.</p>

<p>At 9.45 a. m., the wings having been dried, No. 5 was again tried. The
float was moved back to its normal position at the base of the bowsprit, and the
guys, by which the outer ends of the tail had been depressed in the previous
trial, were so adjusted that the tail was flat. The machine was, therefore, in
the condition of theoretical equilibrium for rapid motion with a plane wing. All
the other conditions were precisely as in the previous trial, except that the
round-end 100-centimetre propellers were substituted for the 95-centimetre ones
which had been broken, and a new paper-covered tail was used. The mechanic
in charge was directed to let the steam reach its highest pressure consistent
with a flight of one-half a minute, before launching the machine, but he seemed
to have lost all sense of the length of time the fuel and water would last, as he
let the engines run until almost the whole charge was exhausted before launching
it. The aerodrome went off almost horizontally, then turned up into the
wind and rose to an angle of about twenty degrees; then (while moving forward)
slowly sank as though the engine power had given out, as in fact it doubtless
had. The actual distance travelled was 123 feet and the length of time 7.2
seconds. While the exhaustion of the fuel and water prior to launching the machine
had prevented what apparently would otherwise have been an <span class="xxpn" id="p104">[p104]</span>
exceedingly good flight, yet the fact that the aerodrome rose immediately after being
launched, and continued to do so until the power gave out, was in itself very
encouraging.</p>

<p>At 1.40 p. m. No. 5 was again ready for trial (the third one for the day),
and this time Mr. Langley and Dr. Bell witnessed it from a greater distance in
hopes of being able more clearly to study its behavior when actually in the air.</p>

<p>The previous trial having missed success through the fuel and water having
been consumed before the machine was launched, special instructions were
given to avoid the recurrence of this mistake. But the machine was held for
probably two minutes after the burners were lighted, with very much the same
result as before. The conditions of the aerodrome were the same as in the
previous trial, except that the tail was a little flatter, so as to tend to make the
head slightly lower in flight. It was launched at an angle of about thirty degrees
with the very gentle wind that was blowing, and, apparently under the direction
of the rudder, turned into the wind, the midrod rising to an angle of
about twenty degrees and (as noted in Mr. Langley’s record book) “The whole
machine absolutely rising during five or six seconds—a fine spectacle! Then
the power visibly gave out, the propellers revolving slower. It settled forward
and lost nearly all of its forward motion at the end of about seven seconds, but
did not finally touch the water until ten and a quarter seconds.”</p>

<p>While the length of time that the aerodrome had been sustained in the air
was so short that no actual flight had really been achieved, yet the results encouraged
the belief that with the aerodrome more accurately balanced, it could
reasonably be hoped that a somewhat longer flight would be obtained. It was,
however, very evident that, although the correct balancing which would insure
equilibrium for a few minutes might soon be attained, the machine,
lacking a human intelligence to control it, must be provided with some mechanism
which would tend to restore the equilibrium, the conditions of which must necessarily
change in a machine depending on the air for its support. In order
to see what could be done in this direction, it was, therefore, decided to return
immediately to Washington with the machines and make some minor changes
in them before attempting further flights.</p>

<p>By the end of May, Nos. 4 and 5 were again in readiness for a trial, and
the mechanics were accordingly sent to Quantico to complete preparations for
the tests. During May Mr. A. M. Herring, who had been experimenting with
model machines for several years, was engaged for a few months as an assistant,
and he was immediately put in charge of the field trials of Nos. 4 and 5,
which were now about to be made. On June 6 Mr. Langley, accompanied by
Mr. Herring, went to Quantico, and on June 7, at 5 a. m., Aerodrome No. 5 was
ready for trial, but the wind was so high that nothing could be done. The wind
later diminished in intensity, but the house-boat had become stuck
on the beach <span class="xxpn" id="p105">[p105]</span>
and it was impossible to make the launching apparatus point directly into the
wind, which was blowing from the rear of the boat. An attempt was made to
launch the aerodrome even with the wind blowing at its rear, but it was found
impossible to make the fires burn and the test was accordingly postponed. Later
in the afternoon the house-boat was floated and the preparations for a test were
immediately completed. At 5.42 p. m. the fires were lighted, but the burners did
not work properly and the proper steam pressure could not be obtained. At
6.20 p. m. the fires were again lighted, and at 6.22 the aerodrome was launched,
its midrod having an upward angle of 25 degrees, or more, with the launching
track. The aerodrome moved off nearly horizontally, but seemed to be very
sluggish in its movement and fell in the water about seventy feet from the boat,
after having been in the air only 4.8 seconds. The damage consisted of a broken
propeller and a slight strain in the main frame, the extent of which, however,
was not immediately seen.</p>

<p>The steam pressure at the time of launching was 110 pounds, which was obviously
insufficient. The aerodrome had lifted fifty per cent of its weight on the
pendulum, and its sluggishness of movement seemed, therefore, unaccountable
even for this pressure. It seemed probable, however, that the pressure ran down
immediately after the machine was launched, on account either of the use of
the light-weight burners in place of the larger and heavier ones, or of the diminution
of the air pressure in the gas tank.</p>

<p>At 7.55 the aerodrome was again launched, and this time made a still shorter
flight than before, being in the air only three seconds. A serious leak in the engine
cylinder was, however, discovered just as the machine was launched, and
this probably accounted for the lack of power.</p>

<p>Not only had the tests which have just been described indicated that there
was a lack of power during flight, although previous pendulum tests had repeatedly
shown lifts greater than fifty per cent, but, furthermore, the wings themselves,
while appearing perfectly capable of supporting the aerodrome when
viewed with the machine stationary, were seen to flex to such an extent in flight
that it seemed probable that much of the power was consumed in merely overcoming
the head resistance of a large portion of the wings which had lost all
lifting effect.</p>

<p>During the fall and winter, as recorded in Chapters VII and VIII <a href="#tocontents">◊</a>, Aerodrome
“New No. 4,” which had been reconstructed during the summer, and
which upon test was found radically weak, was almost entirely rebuilt and afterwards
known as No. 6. Important changes were also made in No. 5, which
greatly increased its strength and power. The improvements, however, which
contributed more than anything else to the marked success achieved in the next
trial of the aerodromes, were those which had to do with the nature and disposition
of the sustaining surfaces and the means for securing equilibrium.
<span class="xxpn" id="p106">[p106]</span></p>

<p>It will be recalled that in the more recent trials the apparent causes of failure
had been the inability to provide sufficiently rigid wings, the great difficulty
of properly adjusting the relative positions of the centers of pressure and gravity,
and the lack of any means of regaining equilibrium when the balance of the
aerodrome had in any way been disturbed. In the fall of 1895, accordingly, it
was finally decided to employ a second pair of wings equal in size to the first or
leading pair. This not only added greatly to the stability of the aerodrome, but
also made it possible, without any alteration in the plan of the frame, to bring
the center of pressure into the proper position relative to the center of gravity.
In addition the plan of constructing the wings was modified by the introduction
of a second main rib, which, placed at approximately the center of pressure
of the wings, made them much stiffer, both against bending and torsion.
The two pairs of wings now became the sole means of support, and the tail
which had hitherto been made to bear part of the weight of the aerodrome, as
well as assist in preserving the longitudinal equilibrium, was now intended to
perform only the latter function. It was placed in the rear of the wings and
was combined with the vertical rudder. Further, in adjusting it on the aerodrome,
it was set at a small negative angle and given a certain degree of elasticity,
as described above. This device proved to be a most efficient means of
maintaining and restoring the equilibrium, when it was disturbed, and its value
was apparent in all future tests of the models.</p>

<h4>1896</h4>

<p>The important changes in the steam-driven models which had been begun
in the previous fall, and which in the case of No. 4 had been so extensive as to
convert it into a new aerodrome, No. 6, were continued during the early spring,
and it was not until the last of April that the models Nos. 5 and 6 were ready
for actual test in free flight.</p>

<div class="figc-s1" id="plt018">
<img src="images/plate18.jpg" width="600" height="798" alt="" />
<div class="caption">PL. 18. HOUSE-BOAT WITH OVERHEAD LAUNCHING
APPARATUS, 1896 <a class="linka" href="#listplates">◊</a></div>
</div>

<p>The condition of No. 5, which made the first successful flight, is given in
the data sheet for May 6, 1896, and its general form at this time may be seen
in the photograph of May 11, Plate <a href="#plt027a">27A</a>. Although the changes described above,
as well as the modifications in the boilers and burners of both aerodromes had
undoubtedly effected a great improvement in every detail of the machines, the
disappointments experienced in the preceding years prevented any great feeling
of confidence that the trials which were now to be made would be entirely successful.
On May 4, however, the two mechanics, Mr. Reed and Mr. Maltby, were
sent down to Quantico with Aerodromes Nos. 5 and 6, and Mr. Langley, accompanied
by Dr. Graham Bell, who had been invited to witness the tests, followed
on the afternoon of the 5th. On May 6 the wind was so very high all the morning
that a test was found impracticable. During the forenoon, however, the
wind gradually died down, and by 1 p. m. was blowing from
six to ten miles an
hour <span class="xxpn" id="p107">[p107]</span> from the northeast. At 1.10 p. m. Aerodrome No. 6 was launched, but the
guy-wire uniting the wings having apparently caught on one of the fixed wooden
strips which held the wings down, the left wing was broken before the aerodrome
was really launched, and the result was that the machine slowly settled
down in the water by the boat, breaking the propellers and slightly injuring
the Pénaud tail.</p>

<p>After removing No. 6 from the water, No. 5 was placed on the launching
car and immediately prepared for a test. At 3.05 p. m. it was launched at a
steam pressure of 150 pounds and started directly ahead into the gentle breeze
which was then blowing. The height of the launching track above the water
was about twenty feet. Immediately after leaving the launching track, the aerodrome
slowly descended three or four feet, but immediately began to rise, its
midrod pointing upward at an increasing angle until it made about ten degrees
with the horizon and then remained remarkably constant at this angle through
the flight. Shortly after leaving the launching track the aerodrome began to
circle to the right and moved around with great steadiness, traversing a spiral
path, as shown in the diagram (Plate <a href="#plt019">19</a>). From an inspection of the diagram
it will be noticed that the aerodrome made two complete turns and started on the
third one. During the first two turns the machine was constantly and steadily
ascending, and at the end of the second turn it had reached a height variously
estimated by the different observers at from 70 to 100 feet. When at this height,
and after the lapse of one minute and twenty seconds, the propellers were seen
to be moving perceptibly slower and the machine began to descend slowly, at
the same time moving forward and changing the angle of inclination of the
midrod until the bow pointed slightly downward. It finally touched the water
to the south of the house-boat at the position shown, the time the machine was
in the air having been one minute and thirty seconds from the moment of launching.
The distance actually traversed, as estimated by plotting its curved path
on the coast-survey chart and then measuring this path, was approximately 3300
feet, which is the mean of three independent estimates. This estimate of the
distance was checked by noting the number of revolutions of the propellers as
recorded by the revolution counter, which was set in motion at the moment the
machine was launched. On the assumption that the slip of the propellers was
not greater than fifty per cent, the 1166 revolutions as shown by the counter
would indicate a distance travelled of 2430 feet. As it was felt very certain
that the slip of the propellers could not have amounted to as much as fifty per
cent, it seemed a conservative estimate to place the length of flight at 3000 feet,
which would mean a rate of travel of between 20 and 25 miles an hour. The circular
path traversed by the aerodrome was accounted for by the fact that the
guy-wires on one of the wings had not been tightened up properly, thus causing
a difference in the lifting effect of the two sides.
<span class="xxpn" id="p108">[p108]</span></p>

<p>The aerodrome was immediately recovered from the water and preparations
made for a second test, the machine being launched again at 5.10 p. m. at a
steam pressure of 160 pounds. The conditions were the same as at the first trial,
except that the wind had changed from north to south and was perhaps of less
velocity than before. The path traversed by the aerodrome in this second trial
was almost a duplicate of the previous one, except that on account of the change
in the direction of the wind the machine was launched in the opposite direction.
In tightening up the guy-wires, which had not been properly adjusted in the previous
test, they were probably tightened somewhat too much, since in this second
test the aerodrome circled towards the left, whereas in the first flight it had
circled towards the right. The aerodrome made three complete turns, rising
to a height of approximately sixty feet with its midrod inclined to the horizon
at a slightly greater angle than before. The propellers again ceased turning
while the machine was high in the air and it glided forward and downward and
finally settled on the water after having been in the air one minute and thirty-one
seconds. The distance travelled was estimated as before, by plotting the
path on the coast-survey chart, and was found to be 2300 feet.</p>

<p>During these flights several photographs were secured of the machine while
it was actually in the air, some of the pictures being taken by Dr. Bell and others
by Mr. F. E. Fowle. The clearest of these are shown in Plates <a href="#plt020">20</a>,
<a href="#plt021">21</a>, and <a href="#plt022">22</a>.</p>

<p>Just what these flights meant to Mr. Langley can be readily understood.
They meant success! For the first time in the history of the world a device produced
by man had actually flown through the air, and had preserved its equilibrium
without the aid of a guiding human intelligence. Not only had this device
flown, but it had been given a second trial and had again flown and had
demonstrated that the result obtained in the first test was no mere accident.</p>

<p>Shortly after returning to Washington, Mr. Langley left for Europe, but
before doing so he gave instructions to the workmen to remedy the small weaknesses
and defects which had been found in Aerodrome No. 6, and to have both
aerodromes ready for trial before his return in the fall.</p>

<p>After returning in the fall, Mr. Langley again had Aerodromes Nos. 5 and
6 taken down to Quantico for trial, and this time had as his invited guest Mr.
Frank G. Carpenter. On November 27 a test was made of Aerodrome No. 6,
the general disposition of which at this time may be learned from the description
in Chapter X <a href="#tocontents">◊</a>, and the photographs in Plates <a href="#plt029a">29A</a>, <a href="#plt029b">29B</a>. The model was launched
at 4.25 p. m. with a steam pressure of 125 pounds. The aerodrome went nearly
horizontally against the wind, and descended into the water in six and a quarter
seconds at a distance of perhaps 100 yards. After the machine had been recovered
from the water, it was found that a pin had broken in the synchronizing
rod which connects the two propeller shafts together, and that the counter, which
showed 495 revolutions of the propellers, had been caused to register <span class="xxpn" id="p109">[p109]</span>
inaccurately on this account. The balancing of Aerodrome No. 6 had been made the
same as that of No. 5, but in No. 6 the line of thrust was twelve centimetres
higher, and this fact, which had not been taken into account in determining the
proper balancing for No. 6, seemed to be sufficient cause for the aerodrome
coming down into the water so soon after being launched. Darkness had descended
before the aerodrome could be recovered and prepared for a second
trial. On the next day, November 28, a high wind prevailed in the morning,
but in the afternoon it became comparatively calm, and No. 6 was launched at
4.20 p. m. under the same conditions as on the preceding day, except that the
float, which weighed 275 grammes, was moved back from the bowsprit eighty
centimetres in order to make the machine lighter in front. The aerodrome was
launched at a steam pressure of not much over 100 pounds, the air draft for
the burners being temporarily bad. The midrod made an angle of approximately
three degrees with the horizontal. On account of a slight rain, which had occurred
just before the machine was launched, the wings were wet and the weight
of the entire aerodrome was doubtless as much as twelve kilos. Immediately on
being launched the aerodrome started directly ahead in a gentle south wind,
moving horizontally and slowly turning to the right and appearing to approach
dangerously near to some thick woods on the west shore. However, it fortunately
continued turning until it pointed directly up the beach with the wind
in the rear. It then moved more rapidly forward, dipped and rose but once,
and this very slightly, and continued its remarkable horizontal flight, varying
not more than two yards out of a horizontal course, and this only for a moment,
until it finally descended into the bay at a point nearly in a line between
the house-boat and the railroad station at Quantico. Upon being recovered, it
was found to be absolutely uninjured, and another flight would have been made
with it immediately but darkness had descended. The time of flight, as determined
independently by two stop-watches, was one minute and forty-five seconds.
The number of revolutions of the propellers was 2801, or at the rate of
1600 R. P. M., which, with an allowance of fifty per cent slip, should have carried
the aerodrome a distance of 4600 feet in one and three-quarter minutes.
While the distance from the house-boat in a straight line to the point at which
the aerodrome descended was only about 1600 feet, yet it was estimated by those
present that this straight-line distance was certainly not greater than one-third
the total length of the path traversed, which would mean a distance of something
like 4800 feet. The length of the course, as plotted on the coast-survey map
and afterwards measured, was 4200 feet, and it, therefore, seemed safe to say
that the total distance travelled was about three-quarters of a mile, and the
speed was, therefore, about thirty miles an hour.</p>

Description of the Launching Apparatus and of
Aerodromes Nos. 5 and 6.">
CHAPTER X<br />
DESCRIPTION OF THE LAUNCHING APPARATUS AND OF
AERODROMES Nos. 5 AND 6
</h3></div>

<p>Reference has already been made to the development of the “cast-off”
apparatus that was used at Quantico for launching the aerodrome. An initial
velocity is indispensable, and after long experiment with other forms which
proved failures, an apparatus was designed by me, which gave a sufficient linear
velocity in any direction. It had, moreover, been found that, when the aerodrome
was attached to any apparatus upon the roof of the house-boat, such
slight changes in the direction and intensity of the wind as would ordinarily pass
unperceived, would tend to distort or loosen it from its support, so that only
the most rigid of fastenings at three independent bearing points were of any use
in holding it, while the wings must be separately fastened down, lest they should
be torn from their sockets. It was, then, necessary to be able to fasten the
aerodrome very firmly to the cast-off apparatus, to start it upon its journey in
any direction with an initial linear velocity that should equal its soaring speed,
and to release it simultaneously at all points at the very same instant, while at
the same time the points of contact of the launching device, to which it had just
been fastened, were themselves drawn up out of the way of the passing propellers
and guys.</p>

<p>All these requirements and others were met by the apparatus finally adopted,
which is shown in Plates <a href="#plt023">23</a> and
<a href="#plt024">24</a>. It consists of a strong timber frame-work,
carrying a track, consisting of two flat iron rails set on edge, upon which runs
the launching car, suspended from two small wheels on each side. At the front
end of the frame there are two cylindrical air buffers to receive the buffing pistons
and thus stop the car after the aerodrome has been released. The car is
drawn to the rear end of the track and held by the bell-crank lever <em class="italic">A</em> (Plate <a href="#plt023">23</a>).
The contact points <em class="italic">BB</em> and <em class="italic">C</em> are turned down and the clutch-hook <em class="italic">D</em> set over the
clutch-post <em class="italic">K</em>. The aerodrome is thus held firmly up against the three points <em class="italic">BB</em>
and <em class="italic">C</em> by the clutch <em class="italic">D</em>, and a distortion from its proper position rendered impossible.
All these points are thrown up out of the way of the projecting portions of
the aerodrome at the instant of release. This result is accomplished as follows:
when the car has reached the proper point in its forward course, the cam <em class="italic">E</em>, which
is hinged at 1, is depressed by a roller fixed to the framework of the device. In
this motion it pushes down the adjustable connections <em class="italic">FF</em>, which are attached at
their lower ends to the bell-crank arms <em class="italic">GG</em>, which turn about a central pivot at
2. Thus the downward movement of the connections <em class="italic">FF</em> opens the jaws of the <span class="xxpn" id="p111">[p111]</span>
clutch <em class="italic">D</em>. While the clutch <em class="italic">D</em> is rigidly attached to <em class="italic">G</em> to prevent transverse
movement, it is hinged to the latter at 3 so that it can fold in a longitudinal direction.
Screwed to the clutch <em class="italic">D</em> is a narrow plate 4, which, when the clutch is
closed, is behind the lug 5, thus preventing any turning about the hinge 3.</p>

<p>But when the arms of <em class="italic">G</em> and the jaws of the clamp are thrown out by the
depression of <em class="italic">F</em>, the plate 4 is moved out from behind the lug 5 and the clamp
is free to fold to the front. The strut, hinged at 6, is under a constant tension
from the spring 7 to fold up, and is prevented from doing so only by the connections
8, by which it is held down until the release of the plate 4 from behind the
lug 5, when the spring snaps them instantly up and out of the way.</p>

<p>As the struts <em class="italic">BB</em> have no fixed connection with the aerodrome, they are released
by the relaxation in the rigidity of the other connections and are thrown
up by their spring 9 and held in that position by the clip 10 catching beneath the
upper cross-piece.</p>

<p>The power for the propulsion of the car is obtained by means of from one
to nine helical springs working under tension, and multiplying their own motion
four times by means of a movable two-sheave pulley, as shown in the
drawing.</p>

<p>When the details of the aerodrome, whose description is to follow, are considered
from the standpoint of the engineer accustomed to make every provision
against breakage and accident and to allow an ample factor of safety in
every part, they will be found far too weak to stand the stresses that were put
upon them. But it must be remembered that in designing this machine, all
precedent had to be laid aside and new rules, adapted to the new conditions, applied.
It was absolutely necessary, in order to insure success, that the weight
should be cut down to the lowest possible point, and when this was reached it
was found that the factor of safety had been almost entirely done away with,
and that the stresses applied and the strength of material were almost equal.</p>

<p>The same observation holds true of the boilers, aeolipile, and engines, when
regarded from the point of view of the economical generation and use of steam.
It was fully recognized that the waste of heat in the coil boilers was excessive,
but as it was necessary that there should be an exceedingly rapid generation of
steam with a small heating surface, this was regarded as inevitable.</p>

<p>In the engine the three points aimed at in the design were lightness, strength
and power, but lightness above all, and necessarily in a degree which long
seemed incompatible with strength. No attempt was made to secure the requirements
of modern steam-engine construction, either in the distribution of the
steam or the protection of the cylinder against the radiation of heat by a suitable
jacketing. The very narrow limits of weight permissible required that the <span class="xxpn" id="p112">[p112]</span>
barrel of the cylinder should be as thin as possible, that no protective jacketing
should be used, and that the valve motion should be of the simplest description.
To obtaining the greatest lightness consistent with indispensable power, everything
else was subordinated; and hence, all expectation of ordinary economical
efficiency had to be abandoned at the outset.</p>

<p>It was only after long trials in other directions that Mr. Langley introduced
the aeolipile device, which for the first time provided sufficient heat. Even
in the aeolipile, however, is was apparent that nothing short of the most complete
combustion accompanied by the highest possible temperature of the flame
would be sufficient for the extreme demand. To secure this result under all
conditions of wind and weather, with the aerodrome at rest and in motion, required
the long series of experiments that are given in another chapter. In
respect to the generation of heat, then, it is probable that it would be difficult to
exceed the performance of the final type of burner in practical work, but in the
utilization of this heat in the boiler, as well as in the utilization of the steam
there generated, the waste was so great as to be prohibitive under ordinary
conditions. But this was not ordinary work, and the simplest protection against
radiation from boiler, separator, and engine could not well be used.</p>

<p>The framework of the aerodrome is made of thin steel tubes, the main or
midrod extending the whole length of the machine and carrying the attachments
to which the wings are fastened. Suspended from this midrod by rigid
connections is a skeleton hull of steel tubing, shaped somewhat like the framework
of a boat, from which, directly abeam of the engines, arms are run out
like the outriggers of a rowboat for carrying the propellers. Within this central
hull are placed the aeolipile, the boiler, and the engine, which with their
auxiliary parts, the pump and the separator, constitute the entire power-generating
apparatus.</p>

<p>The aeolipile consists of four essential parts: the spherical air chamber containing
the supply of compressed air by which the gasoline in the reservoir
tank is forced into the burner; the reservoir tank containing the gasoline that
is to be used as a fuel; the gas generator wherein the liquid gasoline is heated
and converted into gas; and the burners where it is finally utilized to heat the
boilers.</p>

<p>The air chamber <em class="italic">D</em>, Plate <a href="#plt025">25</a>,
is a spherical vessel 120 mm. in diameter, located
at the extreme front end of the hull. It is made of copper 0.25 mm. thick
and has two openings. The front opening has a copper pipe 1 cm. outside diameter,
to which the air pump for charging the chamber is connected. From the
back a copper pipe 5 mm. outside diameter extends to the top of the gasoline
reservoir.</p>

</div>

<p>This reservoir, shown at <em class="italic">I</em>, Plate <a href="#plt025">25</a>, is also a light, hollow sphere 120 mm.
in diameter; both this and the air chamber being made by soldering hemispheres
<span class="xxpn" id="p113">[p113]</span>
of copper together at their circumferences. There are three openings in the
reservoir tank; two at the top and one at the bottom. One of those at the top
serves for the admission of the 5-mm. pipe bringing compressed air from the
air chamber; the other is connected with a pipe 1 cm. in diameter, through which
gasoline is supplied to the tank, and which is closed by a simple plug at the top.
The hole in the bottom serves as the outlet for the gasoline to the burners. Close
to the bottom of the tank there is placed a small needle valve, which serves to
regulate the flow of oil, for, were the pipe left open, the compressed air would
force the oil out with such rapidity that the burners would be flooded and the
intensity of the flame impaired. The construction of this valve is clearly shown
in Plate <a href="#plt026a">26A</a>. It consists of a brass shell having one end (<em class="italic-padr">a</em>) soldered to the bottom
of the tank. The needle enters through a stuffing box whose gland is held
by two small screws. The stem of the needle is threaded and engages in a thread
cut in the body of the casting and is operated by a fine wire on the outside. It
will readily be seen that this device affords a means of making a very accurate
adjustment of the flow of the liquid to the burners.</p>

<p>After leaving the needle valve the gasoline flows along the pipe <em class="italic">S</em>, Plate <a href="#plt025">25</a>,
until it reaches the evaporating coil, <em class="italic">N</em>. In order to subject the oil to as large
a heating surface as possible, in comparison with the sectional area through
which it is flowing, the pipe, which left the needle valve with a diameter of 6 mm.
soon contracted to 5 mm., is here flattened to a width of 7 mm. and a thickness
of 2 mm. There are seven complete turns of this flattened tubing coiled to an outside
diameter of 30 mm. At the end of the seventh coil the pipe is enlarged to a
diameter of 1 cm. and two coils of this size are added, the inside diameter being
the same as that of the flattened coil. This enlarged portion serves as a sort of
expansion chamber for the complete gasification of the gasoline, which is then
led back through a turn of the enlarged pipe, beneath the coils and to the front.
At the front end of the coil a small branch is led off, forming a “bleeder,”
which takes sufficient gas to supply the burner by which the coil is heated, the
products of whose combustion pass into and between the coils of the boiler
like those of the regular heating burners. The gas pipe rises in front of the coil
and by a <em class="italic">T</em> connection branches to the two burners that are placed in front of
the coils of the boiler. These burner pipes are 5 mm. in diameter and enter
sheet-iron hoods forming regular burners of the Bunsen type, which are fully
shown in all their details in the accompanying engraving, Plate <a href="#plt026a">26</a>.
The pipe is
plugged at the end, and a hole 0.9 mm. in diameter drilled for the nipple of the
burner in front of the coil where the water first enters from the separator, and
0.85 mm. for the one in front of the return coil. The face of the burner shell
stands exactly central with and 41 mm. in front of the
coils.<a id="fnanchor_35" href="#footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a>
<span class="xxpn" id="p114">[p114]</span></p>

<p>This constitutes the heat-generating portion of the machine, and with it it
is probable that a flame of as high a temperature is produced as can be reached,
with the fuel used, by any practical device.</p>

<p>The boiler or steam-generating apparatus may be said to consist of three
parts: the separator, the circulating pumps, and the generating coils.</p>

<p>The separator (<em class="italic">M</em> in Plate <a href="#plt025">25</a>) is a device which has attained its present
form after a long course of development. As at present constructed, it is formed
of a hollow sphere 190 mm. in diameter and is located as nearly as possible over
the center of gravity of the whole apparatus. It serves the double purpose of
water reservoir and steam drum, and is called a “separator” on account of
the function which it performs of separating the water from the steam as it enters
from the coils. There is a straight vertical pipe 10 mm. in diameter rising
from the top of the sphere and fastened to the right-hand side of the midrod.
This is used for filling the separator with water. Upon the other side of the
midrod there is a small steam dome 42 mm. in diameter with a semi-spherical
top rising to a height of 70 mm. above the top of the sphere. From this dome
two steam pipes are led off, one to the engine and the other to the steam gauge.</p>

<p>As already stated elsewhere, it was found in the experiments with the coil
boiler that an artificial forcing of the circulation of the water was a necessity,
as the natural circulation was too slow to be of any service. Accordingly, but
only after numerous devices involving less weight had failed, a pump driven
from the engine shaft was designed and used. In the early experiments various
types of pumps were tried in which the valves were opened and closed automatically
by the pressure of the water. It was found, however, that with the
mixture of steam and water to be handled, the valves could not be depended
upon to open and close properly at the high speeds at which is was necessary to
run the engine. In Aerodrome No. 5, therefore, a double-acting pump with a
mechanically operated valve was used. The pump, shown in detail in Plate <a href="#plt026a">26A</a>,
is driven from a shaft connected with the main engine shaft by a spur gear and
pinion, which rotates at half the speed of the engine shaft. The pump itself
consists of two barrels, the main barrel having a diameter of 23 mm. with a
piston stroke of 20 mm. The outer shell of the barrel is made of aluminum
bronze and is lined with a cast-iron bushing 1.25 mm. in thickness. The piston
has a length of 14 mm. and is formed of an aluminum disc and center, having a
follower plate of the same material with two cast-iron split rings sprung in.
The water is received into and delivered from the valve cylinder, which is 18
mm. in diameter and also lined with a cast-iron bushing 1.25 mm. thick. The
aluminum bronze shells of both cylinders are 0.75 mm. in thickness. The valve
is a simple piston valve 35 mm. long with bearing faces 4 mm. long at each end.
The water is taken from the bottom of the separator and led to the center of the
valve chest of the pump by a copper pipe 1 cm. outside diameter.
The ports <span class="xxpn" id="p115">[p115]</span>
leading from the valve to the main cylinder are 3 mm. wide and 34 mm. apart
over their openings. It will thus be seen that when the valve is in its central
position, as it should be at the beginning of the piston stroke, both ports are
covered with a lap of 0.5 mm. inside and out, so that the valve has to move
0.5 mm. before suction or discharge can take place. As the valve is moving most
rapidly at this point, it opens and both functions begin before the piston has advanced
perceptibly. The delivery is made at the ends of the valve cylinder
through two copper pipes of 1 cm. diameter that unite into a single pipe before
reaching the boiler. The throw of the valve is 14 mm. so that the ports are uncovered
and held wide open for the greater portion of the stroke of the piston,
and begin to close only when the latter approaches the end of its stroke. In this
way perfect freedom is given to the flow of the water and all choking is avoided.
As the engine has been run at a speed of more than 688 revolutions per minute,
the pump must have made at least 344 strokes in the same time, thus displacing
166.2 cc. of water. The diameter of the piston rod and valve stem is 3 mm.
and they pass through stuffing boxes with glands of the ordinary type for packing.
This pump served its purpose admirably, and with it it was possible to
maintain a continuous circulation of water through the two coils of the boiler.</p>

<p>The third element in the steam-generating system is the boiler proper<a id="fnanchor_36" href="#footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a>
(Plates <a href="#plt025">25</a> and <a href="#plt026a">26A</a>), which consists of two coils of copper pipe, having an outside
diameter of 10 mm., each coil being formed of 21 turns each 75 mm. in diameter
upon the outside and spaced 7.5 mm. apart, so that the total axial length
of each coil is 36 cm.</p>

<p>The water is delivered to the front end of the right-hand coil, and, first
passing through this, crosses over at the rear of the boiler to the left-hand
coil, returning through it to the front whence it is led to and delivered into the
top of the separator. Here the steam and water are separated, the former
going through the separator and thence to the engine, while the unevaporated
water falls to the bottom to be again taken into the pumps and sent through the
coils.</p>

<p>In order that the draft of the burner and the gases of combustion might not
be dissipated, it was necessary to sheathe the boiler. The method of doing this
is shown in Plate <a href="#plt025">25</a>. It will be seen that the front half of the boiler is wrapped
in a sheet of mica through which the coils can be faintly seen. This, in turn, is
held at the extreme front end by a strip of thin sheet-iron, <em class="italic">O</em>. Over the back
end the stack <em class="italic">Q</em>, made of very thin sheet-iron, is slipped. This has an oblong
cross-section at the lower end where it goes over the boiler; it is provided with
a hole through which the midrod passes, and terminates in a circular opening of
about 10 cm. diameter.
<span class="xxpn" id="p116">[p116]</span></p>

<p>The engine, which is clearly shown in the dimensional drawing, Plate <a href="#plt026b">26B</a>, is
of the plain slide-valve type, using a piston valve and solid piston, without packing
rings. The cylinder is formed of a piece of steel tubing 35 mm. outside diameter,
with flanges 47 mm. in diameter and 2.25 mm. thick brazed to each end,
to which the cylinder heads are attached by small machine screws. Inside this
cylinder is a thin cast-iron bushing in order to obtain a better rubbing surface
for the piston. The cross-head is a small piece of aluminum bronze, running on
round guides that also serve as cylinder braces. There are also four hollow
braces, 5 mm. in diameter, running from the back cylinder head to a corrugated
steel bed-plate, that stands vertically and reaches from one side rod of
the frame of the hull to the other, and to which are bolted the bearings of the
main shaft. The connecting rod has the cross-section of a four-rayed star and
drives a crank in the center of the shaft. The following are some of the principal
dimensions of the engine:</p>

<p>These weights are those determined in December, 1896, when some slight
changes had been made from the conditions existing at the time of the flight by
this aerodrome on May 6. Previous to that time, with a pressure of 130 pounds,
between 1.1 and 1.25 horse-power was given on the Prony brake. At the actual
time of flight the pressure was about 115 pounds, and the actual power very
near 1 horse-power.</p>

<p>The valve stem was pivoted to the center of the valve partly because this was
the lightest connection that could be made, and partly to allow the valve perfect
freedom of adjustment upon the seat. Many parts, such as guides, braces,
crank-pins, wrist-pin and shafts are hollow. The steam is taken in at the front
end of the steam chest, and the exhaust taken out of the center, whence it is led
back to the stack and by means of a forked exhaust pipe discharged in such a
way as to assist the draught of each coil of the boilers. Like the cylinder the
steam chest is made of a piece of steel tubing, 20 mm. diameter on the outside,
with an inside diameter of 19 mm., and is fitted with a cast-iron bushing 0.5 mm.
thick, making the inside diameter of the steam chest 18 mm. It, too, has flanges
brazed to the ends, to which the heads are held by small machine screws.</p>

<p>The shaft for conveying the power to the propeller shafts extends across
the machine from side to side; it is hollow, being 8 mm. outside diameter, with
a hole 5 mm. diameter through the center.</p>

<p>It is formed of five sections: the middle section, containing the crank, has
a length of 110 mm. and is connected at either end, by flanged couplings, to
lengths 320 mm. long, which are in turn extended by the end sections having a
length of 230 mm. In addition to the four main bearings that are bolted to the
pressed-steel bed-plate already mentioned, there are two bearings on the outer
framework on each side. At the outer end of each shaft there is keyed thereto
a bevel gear with an outside diameter of 27 mm. and having 28 teeth. This gear
meshes with one of 35 teeth upon a shaft at right angles to the main shaft and
parallel to the axis of the aerodrome. These two shafts, one on either arm,
serve to carry and transmit the power to the propellers. They are 192 mm. long,
8 mm. in diameter, and are provided with three bearings that are brazed to a
corrugated steel plate forming the end of the outrigger portion of the frame.
These shafts are also hollow, having an axial hole 4 mm. in diameter drilled
through them. The propeller seat has a length of 43 mm. and the propeller is
held in position by a collar 25 mm. in diameter at the front end, from which
there project two dowel-pins that fit into corresponding holes in the hubs of the
propellers, which are held up against the collar by a smaller one screwed into
the back end of the shaft. The thrust of the collar is taken up by a pin screwed
into the end of the forward box and acting as a step against which the shaft
bears, the arrangement being clearly shown by the accompanying drawing,
Plate <a href="#plt026a">26A</a>.
<span class="xxpn" id="p118">[p118]</span></p>

<p>This, then, comprises the motive power equipment of the aerodrome, and,
to recapitulate, it includes the storage, automatic feeding and regulation of the
fuel; the storage, circulation and evaporation of the water; the engine to convert
the expansive power of the steam into mechanical work; and the shafting
for the transmission of the energy developed by the engine to the propellers.</p>

<p>The propellers were made with the greatest care. Those used in the successful
trials were 1 metre in diameter, with an actual axial pitch of 1.25 metres.
They were made of white pine, glued together in strips 7 mm. thick. The hub
had a length of 45 mm. and a thickness or diameter of 25 mm. At the outer edge
the blade had a width of 315 mm. and a thickness of 2 mm. These propellers
were most accurately balanced and tested in every particular; each propeller
blade was balanced in weight with its mate and the pitch measured at every
point along the radius to insure its constancy; finally the two propellers of the
pair to be used together were balanced with each other so that there would be
no disturbance in the equilibrium of the machine. As will be noted from the
foregoing description of the machinery, the propellers ran in opposite directions,
as they were made right-&#160;and left-hand screws. The weight of each propeller
was 362 grammes.</p>

<p>We now turn again to take up the details of the construction of the framework
by which this propelling machinery is carried. The whole aerodrome, as
clearly shown in the photographs, Plates <a href="#plt027a">27A</a> and
<a href="#plt027b">27B</a>, is built about and dependent
from one main backbone or midrod, which extends well forward of all of the
machinery and aft beyond all other parts. This rod, as well as all other portions
of the framework, is of steel tubing. The midrod, being largest, is 20 mm
outside diameter, with a thickness of 0.5 mm. It is to this midrod that the
wings are directly attached, and from it the hull containing the machinery is
suspended.</p>

<p>The plan outline of the hull skeleton is similar to that of the deck of a vessel.
The steel tubing, 0.5 mm. thick, of which it is formed, has an outside diameter
of 15 mm. from the front end to the cross-framing used to carry the propellers,
back of which the diameter is decreased to 10 mm.</p>

<p>The midrod makes a slight angle with this frame, the vertical distance between
the centers of the tubing being 73 mm. at the front and 67 mm. at the
back. The tube, corresponding to the keel of a vessel, is braced to the upper
tubes by light U-shaped ribs and by two 8-mm. tubes forming a V brace on a
line with the back end of the guides of the engine. At the extreme front and
back there is a direct vertical connection to the midrod.</p>

<p>The propeller shafts are 1.23 m. from center to center, and are carried on
a special cross-framing, partaking, as already stated, of the character of an
outrigger
on a row-boat. (See Plate <a href="#plt027b">27B</a>.) The rear rods, which are of 10 mm. steel
tubing, start from the front end of the rear bearings of
the propeller shaft and <span class="xxpn" id="p119">[p119]</span>
extend across from side to side. The top rod is brazed to the side pieces of the
hull and the bottom rod to the keel. They are connected by a vertical strut of
8-mm. tubing at a distance of 265 mm. inside of each propeller shaft. At the
front end of the propeller shaft two more rods run across the frame. The lower
is similar and parallel to the back rod already described, while the upper is bowed
to the front, as shown in the plan view of the frame (Plate <a href="#plt030">30</a>). In order to
take the forward thrust of the propeller a second cross-brace is inserted, which
runs from the rear bearing of the propeller shaft to a point just in advance of
the front head of the cylinder, and is brazed to the two upper tubes of the cross-frame
as well as to the upper tubes of the main framing of the hull. The outer
ends of the tubes of the cross-framing are brazed to a thin, stamped steel plate
which firmly binds them together, while at the same time it forms a base for
attaching the bearings of the propeller shaft. This end plate has a thickness of
one millimetre.</p>

<p>In addition to the framing proper there are two guy-posts which fit into
the sockets <em class="italic">CC</em>, and over which truss wires are drawn, as shown in the side view
in Plate <a href="#plt027a">27A</a>. These posts have a length of 730 mm. from the lower edge of the
socket, and are capped at their lower extremity by a light steel ferrule whose
outside diameter is 10 mm.</p>

<p>From the drawing of the wings of No. 5, shown in Plate <a href="#plt017">17</a>, it will be seen
that they are formed of two pine rods 15 mm. in diameter at the inner ends, tapering
to a half circle of the same diameter at the tips. These rods are connected
by eleven spruce ribs measuring 8 mm.&#160;× 3 mm., and curved, as shown in
the side elevation, these, in turn, being covered by a light white silk drawn so
tightly as to present a smooth, even surface. The total length of the wing is 2
metres, and the width over all is 805 mm. Vertical stiffness is obtained in the
wings by a series of guy-wires, which pass over light struts resting upon the
main rods. These main rods are inserted and held in the wing clamps <em class="italic">A</em> and <em class="italic">B</em>,
Fig. 16, and make an angle of 150° with each other. As is the case with all
other essential details of the aerodrome, a great deal of time and attention was
given to the designing of the wing clamps before a satisfactory arrangement
was secured.</p>

<p>To enable it to control the aerodrome in both directions, the tail-rudder,
Plate <a href="#plt027a">27A</a>, has both a horizontal and a vertical surface, the approximate dimensions
of which are, length 115 cm. (3.8 feet), maximum width 64 cm. (2.1 feet),
giving each quarter section an area of about 0.64 sq. m. (6.9 sq. ft.). It is given
the proper angle and degree of elasticity in a vertical direction by the flat hickory
spring, which fits into the clamp <em class="italic">N</em>, and attaches the rudder to the frame.</p>

<p>The only other attachments of the aerodrome are the reel, float, and counter.
They have nothing whatever to do with the flying of the machine, and are <span class="xxpn" id="p120">[p120]</span>
merely safety appliances to insure its recovery from the water. The reel consists
of a light spool on which a fine cord is wound, one end of which is attached
to a light float that detaches itself and lies upon the surface of the water when
the machine sinks, while the other end is fastened to the spool that goes down
with the aerodrome. The “float” is a light copper vessel with conical ends
which is firmly fastened to the midrod, and which is intended to so lower the
specific gravity of the whole machine that it will not sink. The cylindrical portion
of this float has a length of 250 mm. and a diameter of 170 mm., one cone
having a length of 65 mm. and the other and front one a length of 140 mm.,
which makes the total length of the float 375 mm. It is made of very thin copper,
and served in the successful trials not only as a float to sustain the machine
on the surface of the water, but also as a weight by which the center of gravity
was so adjusted that flight was possible.</p>

<p>The counter records the number of revolutions of the propellers after
launching. It is a small dial counter, reading to 10,000, with a special attachment
which prevents any record being made of the revolutions of the propellers,
until the actual moment of launching, when a piece on the launching apparatus
throws the counter in gear at the instant that the aerodrome leaps into the air.</p>

<p>Aerodrome No. 6, it will be remembered, was the outgrowth of a number of
changes made in No. 4 during the fall of 1895 and the early part of 1896. In
this reconstruction the aim was to lighten the whole machine on account of the
smaller engines in either No. 4 or No. 5. The modifications from No. 4 were
so radical and the differences that exist between Nos. 5 and 6 are so considerable
as to demand careful attention.</p>

<p>As regards general appearance the frame of Aerodrome No. 6 resembles
that of No. 5 in consisting of a single continuous midrod of steel tubing, 20 mm.
in diameter, 0.5 mm. thick, immediately beneath which the hull containing the machinery
is situated. In reconstructing the framework after the tests in January,
1896, had shown it to be dangerously weak, especially against torsion, it was
decided to make the hull only strong enough to carry its contents and to attach
it to the stronger midrod in such a way that all torsional strains would be taken
up by it, whereas in No. 5 the hull structure must bear a large proportion of
such strains. It was therefore built throughout of 8-mm. tubing, 0.3 mm. thick,
and was rigidly attached to the midrod by braces at the front and rear, and also
at the cross-frame. The hull was also made narrower (except at the rear, where
it was widened to contain the boiler) and shorter than the hull of No. 5—an advantageous
change made possible by the fact that the engines were not contained
in the hull, but mounted on the transverse frame.</p>

<div class="figc-s3" id="plt028">

<span class="hhnoshow"><a href="images/plate28e.jpg">lgr</a></span></div>
</div>

<div class="xxpn" id="p121">[p121]</div>

<p>In No. 5, as described above, a single engine mounted at the front end of the
hull communicated its power through transmission shafts and gearing to the
propellers, which were necessarily in the same plane. This brought the line of
thrust very nearly in the same plane as the center of gravity of the aerodrome,
a condition tending to promote instability of longitudinal equilibrium. In No.
6, however, the use of two engines situated on the transverse frame and communicating
their power directly to the propellers, made it possible to raise the
transverse frame 12 cm. above the hull, and thus raise the line of thrust to a
position intermediate between the center of pressure and the center of gravity,
without materially affecting the latter. As a result of this change Aerodrome
No. 6 was rendered much more stable and made steadier flights with fewer undulations
than No. 5.</p>

<p>The engines in use on No. 6 were the small engines described above in connection
with No. 4. The cylinders were of steel tubing 2.8 cm. in diameter, with
a 5-cm. stroke, each cylinder thus having a capacity of 30.8 cc. They were lined
with a thin cast-iron bushing and cast-iron rings were sprung in the piston head
so as to give as smooth a rubbing surface and as perfect action as possible. As
in the engine of No. 5 a plain sliding valve of the piston type was used, cut-off
being approximately at one-half, though the ports were so small that it was difficult
to determine it with any great accuracy. No packing was used, but the
parts were carefully ground so as to give a perfect fit.</p>

<p>These engines, as is most clearly shown in Plate <a href="#plt030">30</a>, were mounted symmetrically
on either side of the cross-frame and were connected directly to the
propeller shafts. In order to insure that the propellers would run at the same
rate, there was provided a synchronizing shaft, <em class="italic">T</em>, in Plate <a href="#plt030">30</a>, having on each
end a bevel gear, which intermeshed with similar gears on the propeller shafts.
Steam for the cylinders was conveyed from the separator through the pipes <em class="italic">LL</em>.</p>

<p>The steam-generating apparatus for No. 6 was exactly like that already described
in connection with No. 5, the only difference being in the more compact
arrangement in the case of No. 6. The relative location of the apparatus in the
two models is clearly shown in Plates <a href="#plt028">28</a>,
<a href="#plt029b">29B</a>, and <a href="#plt030">30</a>, the corresponding parts being
similarly labeled, so that a separate description for No. 6 is superfluous.</p>

<p>The wings used on No. 6 were somewhat smaller than those of No. 5, and
differed from them in having the front mainrib bent to a quadrant at its outer
extremity and continued as the outer rib of the wing. The degree of curvature
of the wings was also somewhat less, being one-eighteenth for No. 6 and one-twelfth
for No. 5. The four wings were of the same size and had a total area
of 54 sq. ft. On account of the shortened hull of No. 6 they were allowed a
much greater range of adjustment, which rendered it much easier to bring the
<em class="italic">CP</em> into the proper relative position to the <em class="italic">CG</em>
than was the ease with No. 5.
<span class="xxpn" id="p122">[p122]</span></p>

<p>The Pénaud rudder for No. 6 was similar to that for No. 5, the two in fact
being interchangeable, and was similarly attached to the frame. The reel, float,
counter, and all other accessories were identical for the two machines.</p>

<p>To sum up the comparative features of these two successful steam-driven
models: Aerodrome No. 6 was both lighter and frailer than No. 5, and required
much more delicate adjustment, but when the correct adjustments had been made
its flying qualities were superior, as regards both speed and stability.</p>

<p class="center">
A Description of Mechanical Flight. By S. P. Langley.
</p>

<p>In a communication which I addressed to the Academy in July, 1891,
I remarked that the results of experimental investigation had shown
the possibility of constructing machines which could give such a
horizontal velocity to bodies resembling in shape inclined planes,
and more than a thousand times heavier than air, that these could be
sustained on this element.</p>

<p>While I have elsewhere remarked that surfaces other than planes might
give better results, and that absolutely horizontal flight, which is
so desirable in theory, is hardly realizable in practice, so far as
I know there has never been constructed, up to the present time, any
heavy aerodrome, or so-called flying-machine, which can keep itself
freely in the air by its own force more than a few seconds, the
difficulties encountered in absolutely free flight being, for many
reasons, immeasurably greater than those experienced when the flight
is controlled by the body’s pressing upward against a horizontal
track, or whirling-arm. No one is unaware that many experimenters
have been engaged in trying to execute free mechanical flight, and
although the demonstration which I furnished in 1891 [“Experiments in
Aerodynamics,” 1891] of its theoretical possibility with means then
at our disposition, seemed conclusive, so long a time has elapsed
without practical results, that it might be doubted whether these
theoretical conditions are to be realized. I have thought it well,
then, to occupy myself with the construction of an aerodrome with
which I might put my previous conclusions to the test of experiment.</p>

<p>The Academy will, perhaps, find it interesting to read the narrative
given here by an eye-witness, who is well known to it. I am led to
present it not only by the request with which he honors me, but by
the apprehension that my administrative duties may put a stop to
these researches, so that it seems to me advisable to announce the
degree in which I have already succeeded, although this success be
not as complete as I should like to make it.</p>

<p>The experiments took place on a bay of the Potomac River, some
distance below Washington. The aerodrome was built chiefly of steel,
though lighter material entered into the construction, so that its
density as a whole was a little below unity. No gas whatever entered
into the construction of the machine, and the absolute weight,
independent of fuel and water, was about 11 kilos (24 pounds). The
width of the supporting surfaces was about 4 metres (13 feet), and
the power was furnished by an extremely light engine of approximately
one horse-power. There was no one to direct it on board, and the
means for keeping it automatically in horizontal flight were not
complete. It is
important to remark that the small dimensions of the
machine did not allow it to include any apparatus for condensing the
steam, so that it could only carry water enough for a very brief
course—a drawback which would not be encountered in one of a larger
construction.</p>

<p>It is also to be noted that the speed estimated by Mr. Bell was that
obtained in a continuous ascending flight, and much less than would
have been attained in a horizontal course.</p>

<p class="center wstop-d">On Mechanical Flight. Letter of Mr. Alexander
Graham Bell to Mr. Langley.</p>

<p class="signature">Washington, May 6, 1896.</p>

<p>I am quite aware that you are not desirous of publication until you
have attained more complete success in obtaining horizontal flight
under an automatic direction, but it seems that what I have been
privileged to see to-day marks such a great progress on everything
ever before done in this way, that the news of it should be made
public, and I am happy to give my own testimony on the results of two
trials which I have witnessed to-day by your invitation, hoping that
you will kindly consent to making it known.</p>

<p>For the first trial, the apparatus, chiefly constructed of steel
and driven by a steam engine, was launched from a boat at a height
of about 20 feet from the water. Under the impulse of its engines
alone, it advanced against the wind and while drifting little, and
slowly ascending with a remarkably uniform motion, it described
curves of about 100 metres in diameter; till at a height in the
air which I estimate at about 25 metres (82 feet), the revolutions
of the screws ceased for want of steam, as I understood, and the
apparatus descended gently and sank into the water, which it reached
in a minute and a half from the start. It was not damaged, and was
immediately ready for another flight.</p>

<p>In the second trial it repeated in nearly every respect the action of
the first, and with an identical result. It rose smoothly in great
curves until it approached a prominent wooded promontory, which it
crossed at a height of 8 to 10 metres above the tops of the highest
trees, upon the exhaustion of the steam descending slowly into the
bay, where it settled in a minute and thirty-one seconds from the
start. You have an instantaneous photograph of it, which I took just
after the launch. [See plates <a href="#plt020">20</a>,
<a href="#plt021">21</a>, and <a href="#plt022">22</a> of present work.]</p>

<p>From the extent of the curves which it described, which I estimated
with other persons, from measurements which I took, and from the
number of revolutions of the propellers, as recorded by the automatic
counter which I consulted, I estimate the absolute length of each
course to be over half an English mile, or, more exactly a little
over 900 metres (2953 feet).</p>

<p>The duration of flight during the second trial was one minute and
thirty-one seconds, and the average velocity between twenty and
twenty-five miles an hour, or, let us say 10 metres a second, in a
course which was constantly ascending. I was extremely impressed
by the easy regular course of each trial, and by the fact that the
apparatus descended each time with such smoothness and gentleness as
to render any jar or danger out of the question.</p>

<p>It seemed to me that no one could have witnessed these experiments
without being convinced that the possibility of mechanical flight had
been demonstrated.</p></div>

One pound of twisted rubber appears, from my
experiments, to be capable of momentarily yielding nearly 600
foot-pounds of energy, but this effect is attained only by twisting
it too far. It will be safer to take at most 300 foot-pounds, and as
the strain must be taken up by a tube or frame weighing at least as
much as the rubber, we have approximately 0.0091 as the horse-power
for one minute, or 0.091 horse-power for six seconds as the maximum
effect, in continuous work, of a pound of <em class="italic">twisted</em> rubber strands.
The longitudinal pull of the rubber is much greater, but it is
difficult to employ it in this way for models, owing to the great
relative weight of the tube or frame needed to bear the bending
strain. In either form, rubber is far more effective for the weight
than any steel spring (see later chapter on Available Motors).</p></div>

Observers following de Lucy have long since called
attention to the fact that as the scale of Nature’s flying things
increases, the size of the sustaining surfaces diminishes relatively
to the weight sustained. M. Harting (Aeronautical Society, 1870) has
shown that the relation
<span class="nowrap">√area&#47;<img class="letter5"
 src="images/cuberoot.u221be.jpg" width="48"
 height="90" alt="u+221b" />weight</span> is surprisingly
constant when bats varying in weight as much as 250 times are the
subject of the experiment, and later observations by Marey have not
materially affected the statement. As to the muscular power which
Nature has imparted with the greater or lesser weight, this varies,
decreasing very rapidly as the weight increases. The same remark
may be made apparently with at least approximate truth, with regard
to the soaring bird, and the important inference is that if there
be any analogy between the bird and the aerodrome, as the scale
of the construction of the latter increases, it may be reasonably
anticipated that the size of the sustaining surfaces will relatively
diminish rather than increase. We may conveniently use M. Harting’s
formula in the form
<em class="italic">a</em>&#160;=
<em class="italic-padr">n</em><sup>2</sup><em class="italic-padr">w</em><sup>(2&#47;3)</sup>&#160;=

A singular fact connected with the stretching of rubber
is that the extension is not only not directly proportional to the
power producing it, but that up to a certain limit it increases more
rapidly than the power, and after this the relation becomes for a
time more nearly constant, and after this again the extension becomes
less and less in proportion.</p>

<p>In other words, if a curve be constructed whose abscissae represent
extensions, and ordinates the corresponding weights, it will show
a reverse curvature, one portion being concave toward the axis of
abscissae, the other convex.</p></div>

The following formulæ proposed by Mr. Chas. M. Manly
show how the center of pressure may be moved any desired distance
either forward or backward without in any way affecting the center
of gravity, and by merely moving the front and rear wings the same
amounts but in opposite directions, the total movement of each wing
being in either case five times the amount that is desired to move
the mean <em class="italic">CP</em><sub>1</sub>, and the direction of movement of the front wing
determining the direction of movement of <em class="italic">CP</em><sub>1</sub>.</p>

<p>In Figure 7, <em class="italic">CP</em><sub>fw</sub> and <em class="italic">CP</em><sub>rw</sub> are the centers of pressure of
the front and rear wings respectively; the weights of the wings,
which are assumed to be equal and concentrated at their centers of
figure, are represented by <em class="italic">w</em>, <em class="italic">w</em>, and <em class="italic">a</em> is the distance of the
center of pressure in either wing from its center of figure. The
original mean center of pressure of the aerodrome is <em class="italic">CP</em><sub>1</sub>, <em class="italic">W</em> is
the weight of the aerodrome, supposed to be concentrated at <em class="italic">CG</em><sub>1</sub>,
while <em class="italic">m</em> is the distance from <em class="italic">CP</em><sub>rw</sub> to <em class="italic">CG</em><sub>1</sub>.</p>

<p id="p052">Now, if we have assumed that the rear wing, being of the same size
as the front one, has a lifting effect of only 0.66, and on this
assumption is calculated the proper relative positions of the front
and rear wings to cause the <em class="italic">CP</em><sub>1</sub> to come directly over the
<em class="italic">CG</em><sub>1</sub>, and upon testing the aerodrome find
that it is too heavy in front and, therefore, wish to move the center of pressure forward an amount,
say <em class="italic">b</em>, without affecting the center of gravity, we can calculate the proper relative positions of the
front and rear wings in the following manner. While the aerodrome as a whole is balanced at the
point <em class="italic">CG</em><sub>1</sub>, the weight of the wings is not balanced around this point, for the rear wing, owing to
its decreased lifting effect, is proportionately farther from <em class="italic">CP</em><sub>1</sub> than the front wing. In order, therefore,
to avoid moving the center of gravity of the machine as a whole, any movement of the wings
must be made in such a way as to cause the difference between the weight of the rear wing multiplied
by its distance from <em class="italic">CG</em><sub>1</sub> and the weight of the front multiplied by its distance from <em class="italic">CG</em><sub>1</sub>

CHAPTER I<br />
INTRODUCTORY
</h3>

<p>Although in 1896 Mr. Langley had made the firm resolution not to undertake
the construction of a large man-carrying machine, as he realized that his
multitudinous administrative duties left him practically no time available for
original research, yet the longing to take the final great step of actually transporting
a human being through the air, which the successful flights of the models
had now for the first time in the history of the world actually proved to be
possible, soon became irresistible.</p>

<p>Ten years of almost disheartening difficulties, a full appreciation of which
can hardly be gained from the preceding description, had already been spent in
demonstrating that mechanical flight was practicable, and Mr. Langley thoroughly
realized that the construction of a large aerodrome would involve as
great, if not even greater difficulties. Nevertheless, his indomitable will, which
balked at no obstacle, however great it might seem, prevailed against the advice
of his close friends and associates, and even that of his physician, who had
counselled him that a resumption of concentrated thought and vigorous endeavor
would materially shorten his life, which had already passed three score
years. Only a few were privileged to come into close contact with him in his
daily work, and thereby catch the inspiration of his unwavering persistence, his
ceaseless perseverance, his plain inability to submit to defeat; but no one who
has read the record of his astronomical expedition to Mt. Whitney, or the story
of his development of the Bolometer, or the preceding chapters of this history
of his years of patient work in the development of the flying machine, can have
failed to obtain some appreciation of this most striking feature of his character.
Having once determined on the accomplishment of a definite object, no amount
of difficulty that might arise deterred him from pushing on until in some way
and by some means he had succeeded; and no one appreciated better than he
that if the thin edge of the right wedge can be inserted under an obstacle, that
obstacle can be removed, no matter how formidable it may seem.</p>

<p>The undertaking of the construction of a large aerodrome was very largely
influenced by President McKinley, who had become impressed with the great <span class="xxpn" id="p124">[p124]</span>
possibilities of a flying machine as an engine of war. When he found that Mr.
Langley was willing to devote his own time to the development of a machine,
provided the Government would furnish the funds for the actual construction
and tests of it, he appointed a joint board, consisting of Army and Navy officers,
to investigate and report on the plans with which Mr. Langley had achieved
success with the models. The report of this joint board of Army and Navy
officers being favorable, the Board of Ordnance and Fortification of the War
Department, at the direction of President McKinley, requested Mr. Langley to
undertake the construction and test of a machine, which, while not expected to
be a practical war machine, might finally lead to the development of such an engine
of war. In this connection it is interesting to read a letter which Mr. Langley
addressed to the Board of Ordnance and Fortification at the time he undertook
this work.</p>

man, the investigation to include the construction, development and test of such
a machine under conditions left as far as practicable in my discretion, it being
understood that my services are given to the Government in such time as may
not be occupied by the business of the Institution, and without charge.</p>

<p class="first"><span class="smmaj">ATTACHED TO MY LETTER OF THIS DATE
TO THE BOARD OF ORDNANCE AND FORTIFICATION</span></p>

<p class="wstop-d">While stating that I have, so far as I know, an exclusive right of property
in the results of the experiments in aerodromics which I have conducted heretofore
and am now conducting, and while understanding that this property and
all rights connected with it, whether patentable or otherwise, will remain mine
unqualifiedly, I am glad to place these results, without charge, at the service of
the Board of Ordnance and Fortification for the special construction at present
proposed, which seems to me to be of National utility.
<span class="xxpn" id="p125">[p125]</span></p>

<p>I assume that no public statement will be made by the permission of the
Board until the work is terminated, but that I may publish ultimately at my
discretion a statement of any scientific work done in this connection.</p>

<p>I understand that the exercise of this discretion includes the ordering and
purchase of all material by contract or in open market, and the employment of
any necessary help, without restriction, and that, while I desire that no money
shall pass through my hands, itemized bills for each expenditure, made in proper
form and approved by me, will be paid by the Chief Signal Officer.</p>

<p>Much has already been spent at the Smithsonian Institution for the purpose
in question, in special apparatus, tools and experiments, and in recent
constructions now actually going on, which have involved still more time than
money, and which are essential for experimental use in building the proposed
machine; and since to re-create all this independently would greatly defer progress,
I assume that my discretion includes the decision as to how far this shall
be used and paid for at the cost of this allotment (it being understood that I
have no personal property in any of the material which might be transferred for
the purpose of the work); and I also assume that my discretion includes the decision
as to where the work shall be conducted—that is, whether in shops already
constructed, or in others to be elsewhere erected or rented, with the necessary
adjuncts, whether on land or water, and generally whatever is necessary
to the earliest attainment of the object desired by the Board.</p>

<p>As is always the case in experimental work, especially in a field so very new
as was the field of aerodromics at the time that this larger construction was undertaken,
the “plant,” or shops and laboratories required for the constructional
and testing work, grew to a size far beyond what seemed even remotely possible
at the beginning of the work; and even the mere administration involved in
the carrying on of this work proved to be no inconsiderable matter before it had
progressed very far.</p>

<p>The years of experiment with the models had demonstrated clearly that the
greatest difficulty in the development of the aerodrome was the construction of
a suitable power generator, which should combine the elements of extreme lightness
and unusual power with a fair degree of durability. Although remarkably
good results had been secured in the case of the models through the use of steam,
it was realized from the first that not only would the development of a steam-power
plant for a large man-carrying aerodrome present difficulties of a constructional
nature, but that such a steam plant would necessarily be so fragile
and delicate as to make it a constant menace to the machine which it was to propel.
The solution of the difficulty, it was believed, was to be found in the use of
an internal combustion engine; but Mr. Langley had had very little experience
with such engines, and was averse therefore to undertaking the construction of
a large aerodrome until he had assurance that a suitable gasoline engine could
be secured. Before making an agreement to attempt the work for the War <span class="xxpn" id="p126">[p126]</span>
Department, he had, therefore, made a search for a reliable builder who would undertake
to construct a gasoline engine of not less than 12 horse-power to weigh
not exceeding 100 pounds, and what then seemed a safe contract had been entered
into with such a builder to supply one engine which would meet these
requirements.</p>

<p>Almost immediately before the Board of Ordnance and Fortification had officially
placed the work in Mr. Langley’s hands and had made an allotment of
fifty thousand dollars to meet the expenses thereof, it was found that the engine
builder could not be depended on, and that it would, therefore, be necessary
to find one who was more reliable and more experienced in the construction
of light engines. After a most extended search for the best builder to undertake
this work, a contract was entered into on December 12, 1898, with Mr.
S. M. Balzer, an engine builder in New York City. He was to furnish a
twelve-horse-power
engine to weigh not more then 100 pounds, and delivery of it was to
be made on or before February 28, 1899. With this great problem of the engine
apparently provided for, every facility of the Institution shops was pressed to
the utmost limit in order to have the frame, supporting surfaces, launching apparatus,
and other accessories ready as soon as possible after the delivery of
the engine. It was expected from the first that more power would be necessary
than this one engine would furnish, and provision had been made in the contract
that a duplicate engine should be constructed immediately after the completion
of this first one. From past experience, however, it was not likely that the correct
balancing of the aerodrome could be determined from <em class="italic">a priori</em> calculation
based on the results obtained with the models, and it was, therefore, expected
that the aerodrome would have to be launched several times before a successful
flight could be obtained. In view of this it was planned to make a test of the
machine as soon as the first engine was ready, with the expectation that, while
the aerodrome would not have sufficient power to fly, yet the test would furnish
definite data on the all-important question of balancing, and also determine
whether or not the launching apparatus would require modification. In fact,
Mr. Langley felt so apprehensive that the first, and possibly the second test,
would be unsuccessful that, in order to avoid the possibility of a fatal accident,
it was planned that a dummy should be used to represent the weight of the
man in these preliminary tests.</p>

<p>This plan, however, was not carried out. In 1903, when the large aerodrome
was finally completed, so much time had been lost that the writer proposed to
assume the risks of such an accident and to guide the machine in its first test,
in the hope of avoiding a disaster, with the consequent delay of months for repairs,
which the presence of a controlling hand capable of correcting any inaccuracies
of balancing rendered far less likely to occur. To this proposal Mr.
Langley assented with great reluctance, as he fully
realized the danger involved.
<span class="xxpn" id="p127">[p127]</span></p>

<p>Particular attention is called to the above facts, which clearly show that
while a certain degree of success in the initial tests was later hoped for, yet
from the beginning it had been felt rather certain that several tests would have
to be made before final success would be achieved.</p>

<p>To those experienced in scientific experiments this realization of the probability
of several tests being necessary before success could reasonably be expected
does not seem strange, for the record of past experience contains very
few examples of epoch-making inventions springing full fledged from the hand
of their maker and proving a success on the first test.</p>

<p>The two experiments made in the fall of 1903, in which the aerodrome was
each time so damaged in the process of launching that its ability to fly was
never really tested, should therefore be considered merely as the first of a series
which it had been expected would need to be made before success would be
achieved. Further tests were made impossible at the time on account of the
lack of funds, the expense of such work being unusually heavy.</p>

<p>While the lack of funds, therefore, was the real cause of the temporary suspension
of the work, yet an influence which does not often enter into scientific
work—the unjust criticism of a hostile press—was directly responsible for the
lack of funds. It seems very certain that had it not been for this criticism of
the press the funds would have been readily forthcoming for continuing the
work to the point of success.</p>

<h3 title="Chapter II. General Considerations.">CHAPTER II<br />
GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS
</h3></div>

<p>In the development of man-carrying flying machines two well-defined paths
are open. First: Starting with gliding machines, in which gravity furnishes
the motive power, the operator may by practice acquire sufficient skill in controlling
them to warrant the addition of propelling mechanism, and individual
skill in control may be gradually replaced by automatic controlling mechanism.
Second: From self-propelled models, possessing automatic-equilibrium
controlling mechanism, and of a sufficient size to furnish determinative data,
one may, by proper modification in size and construction, progress to an automatically
controlled man-carrying machine in which, for ideal conditions, no
especial skill on the part of the operator is required. Each method has its
advantages.</p>

<p>After concluding his earlier and purely physical researches, the results of
which were embodied in “Experiments in Aerodynamics,” Mr. Langley was so
firmly convinced of the practicability of mechanical flight that he undertook
the construction of the model aerodromes in order to demonstrate it. It is very
doubtful if at any time, prior to the successful flights of the models in 1896, he
seriously contemplated the construction of man-carrying machines. His object
in developing the models was not, therefore, to furnish a prototype for a large
machine, but merely to demonstrate the feasibility of mechanical flight; and this
he did. This is shown very clearly by the closing remark of the article he published
in 1897, describing the flights of the models. “I have now brought to a
close the portion of the work which seemed to be specially mine—the demonstration
of the practicability of mechanical flight-—and for the next stage, which
is the commercial and practical development of the idea, it is probable that the
world may look to others.”<a id="fnanchor_37" href="#footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> When he later undertook the construction of the
large machine for the War Department it was natural that, with the inspiring
sight of the models in flight still fresh in his mind, he determined to use as a
prototype these successful machines, which were the only things of human construction
that had ever really flown for any considerable distance.</p>

<p>Not being an engineer, and realizing that to pass from the construction of
models to that of man-carrying machines involved the solution of many engineering
problems, Mr. Langley, in the spring of 1898, sought the advice of Dr.
R. H. Thurston, who had from the first manifested the deepest interest in his <span class="xxpn" id="p129">[p129]</span>
work in aerodromics. On the recommendation of Dr. Thurston he engaged the
services of the writer, who assumed charge of the work in June, 1898.</p>

<p>While the method of “cut and try” had brought success in the models, and
was perhaps the only method by which they could have been successfully developed,
it was thought that, with these models as a basis of design, much time
would be saved by making an analytical study of them as engineering structures,
and from the data thus obtained the proper proportions for the parts of the
larger machine could be calculated.</p>

<p>Such an analytical study, however, revealed very little from which to make
calculations as to the strength necessary for the various parts of the large machine,
but it did show very clearly that most of the parts were working under
stresses generally far above the elastic limit of the materials, and in many cases
the ultimate breaking strength was closely approached. Such a condition was
the natural outcome of the method by which these models had been developed—all
the various parts having been built at first of the least possible weight and,
when they proved too weak, strengthened until they would withstand the stresses
imposed on them. It is extremely doubtful if previous calculations as to the
strength necessary would have been of any assistance, in fact it is probable
that it would have been a distinct disadvantage and would have resulted in the
machines being entirely too heavy for flight.</p>

<p>The exact strength which had been incorporated in the frames of the models
was as unknown as was the exact amount of the stresses which they has been
made to withstand. Their static strength was easily determined by calculation,
but the stresses due to the live loads were incapable of exact determination
from the available data, for stresses produce strains, which in turn generally
cause distortions accompanied by greatly increased stresses. While exact data
were, therefore, lacking as to stresses and strengths in many of the important
parts, yet the models furnished most important illustrations of unusual strength
for minimum weight, and a careful study of them showed many ways in which
increased strength could be obtained with decreased weight which could hardly
have been devised without these concrete examples.</p>

<p>It was, however, by no means possible to build the large aerodrome within
the permissible limits of weight by simply increasing the various parts of the
models according to some predetermined function of the size of the whole.</p>

<p>The fundamental difficulty is that inevitably, by the laws of geometry,
which are mere expressions of the properties of space, if a solid of any form is
magnified, the weight increases as the cube, while the surface increases only as
the square, of the linear dimensions. Successive generations of physicists and
mathematicians pointed out that while this “law of the cube” is of advantage
in the construction of balloons, yet it is a stumbling
block that will prevent man <span class="xxpn" id="p130">[p130]</span>
from ever building a dynamic flying machine sufficiently large to carry even one
human being.<a id="fnanchor_38" href="#footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></p>

<p>However, since strength is a function of material and form rather than
weight, it is possible by selecting proper materials and adopting suitable structural
forms to evade to a certain extent this “law of the cube.” The whole history
of structural science has therefore been a series of attempts to find stronger
and lighter material and to discover methods of so modifying form as to dispense
with all parts of a structure that do not contribute to its strength. So in
aerodromics the structural problem has been that of finding materials and forms
best suited to the purpose for which they are required, for it does not always
follow that either the form or the material best suited for one scale of construction
is the most advantageous to employ on a different scale. Nor is even the form
or material which gives the greatest strength for the least weight necessarily
the best to employ. For the structural problem must necessarily be co-ordinated
with those of balancing, propelling, and transporting, and each must, therefore,
have its proper attention in the design of the whole machine.</p>

<p>Many of the general considerations of the design of an aerodrome sufficiently
large to transport a man were determined during the spring and summer
of 1898, when the first actual drawings (Plate <a href="#plt032">32</a>, Figs. 1, 2 and 3) of the proposed
machine were made. Starting with the assumption that the Models Nos.
5 and 6 were capable of transporting a load of approximately ten pounds more
than their weight, it was seen that, since the supporting surface of any aerodrome
would increase approximately as the square of the linear dimensions, in
order to carry a man the aerodrome would need to be approximately four times
the linear dimensions of these models. Calculations based on the results accomplished
in the construction of the models indicated that such an aerodrome
would need to be equipped with engines developing 24 horse-power. The best
that could reasonably be hoped for was that these engines would not weigh over
200 pounds, and, therefore, allowing 40 pounds for fuel and fuel tanks, it became
necessary to bring the weight of frame, supporting surfaces, tail, rudder,
propellers and every other accessory within 250 pounds, if the total weight of
the machine, including 150 pounds for the aeronaut, was not to exceed 640
pounds, or 16 times the combined weight of the model and its load of 10 pounds.
Although the problem of constructing the frame, wings and all other parts
within the limit of 250 pounds seemed indeed formidable, it was believed that the
greatest obstacle in the production of such a machine would be that of securing a
sufficiently light and powerful engine to propel it.</p>

<div class="xxpn" id="p131">[p131]</div>

<p>A brief account has already been given of the attempts made by Mr. Langley
to secure a suitable gasoline engine for the large aerodrome, but the difficulties
encountered in the search have not perhaps been sufficiently emphasized.
At this time (1898) the automobile industry, through which has come the development
of the gasoline engine, was in its infancy, and there were few builders
either in the United States or Europe who were attempting anything but
rough and heavy construction. Many of them were enthusiastic over the possibilities
of the internal combustion engine, and were ready to talk of devising
such an engine as the aerodrome would require, but few were willing to guarantee
any such definite results as were demanded. However, the prospects of securing
a suitable gasoline engine from a reliable builder within a reasonable
time seemed so strong that it was decided early in 1898 to begin the construction
of the frame on the general plan which would probably be best adapted for
use with a gasoline engine, and in case it finally proved impossible to secure such
an engine, to construct later a steam plant which could be adapted to this particular
frame.</p>

<p>Some tentative work on the construction of the frame was accordingly begun
in the summer of 1898, some months before an engine builder was found
who seemed likely to be successful in furnishing the engines. An extensive
series of tests on propellers was also made at this time for the immediate purpose
of determining what form and size would be best, since the dimensions of
the transverse frame could not be definitely settled until it was known how large
the propellers would need to be.</p>

<p>Preliminary designs were also begun for the wings, rudders, and launching
apparatus, but when the point was reached of actually making the working
drawings for these, it was seen that the change in the scale of the work required
many important modifications in constructional details. As the models
had flown successfully only three times, and in each case under practically the
same conditions, it was felt that it would be unwise to make changes in important
details without first making a series of tests of the models in flight to
determine the effect of such changes. It was therefore decided to completely
overhaul Models Nos. 5 and 6, strengthening them in many important parts and
“tuning up” their power plants, which had slightly deteriorated since they
were last used in November, 1896. When the work of preparing these models
for further experiments was begun it was thought that it would require at most
only a few weeks, but as it progressed it was found that certain parts of the
mechanical work on the engines had been so poorly executed originally that it
would be necessary to practically rebuild the engines. The final result was that
the power plants of both aerodromes were entirely rebuilt, and they were not
ready for actual test in flight until the spring of 1899.
<span class="xxpn" id="p132">[p132]</span></p>

<p>Much of the preliminary work necessary for the determination of actual
working plans was therefore completed in the summer and fall of 1898, and when
on December 12 a seemingly satisfactory contract for the engines for the large
aerodrome had been made it was thought that rapid progress could be made on
the constructional work after January 1, 1899, when the allotment from the War
Department would become available.</p>

<div class="section">

<div class="xxpn" id="p133">[p133]</div>

<h3 title="Chapter III. Experiments With Models.">CHAPTER III<br />
EXPERIMENTS WITH MODELS</h3></div>

<p>Immediately after the contract for the engine had been placed and the
actual work had been begun, attention was given to the problem of providing
means for properly launching the aerodrome. On the theory that the plan of
launching the small aerodromes, which had finally been adopted after many years
of painstaking experiment, would be the best to employ for the large aerodrome,
Mr. Langley decided to have constructed a large house-boat with the launching
track arranged on it in a way similar to that used for the small machines.
While the general plans for this boat had been under consideration for some
time, the actual working drawings were completed in January, 1899, and so
great seemed the need for expediting its construction, in order to have it ready
at the time when the engine was expected, that the contract which was made
for its construction specifically provided for its being completed promptly, there
being a large forfeit to cover any delay on the part of the contractor.</p>

<p>While the boat itself was being constructed, the working drawings were
completed for the house to be built on it, and a contract was made for the construction
of this house within a given period, there being also a time forfeit in
this contract.</p>

<p>When the end of February arrived, it was found that, although the engine
builder had succeeded in constructing an engine which weighed one hundred
pounds, and which theoretically should have given something over twelve horse-power,
yet he was unable to make it work properly. And then began a protracted
period of most exasperating delays, the engine builder promising from
week to week that certainly within the succeeding ten days he would be able to
make delivery of the engine developing the full horse-power for which the contract
called. After this delay on the engine had continued for some months—a
delay which necessitated the cessation of the work on the main steel frame
of the aerodrome, as it was deemed best to make certain tests of the engine
running while supported by a portion of the frame to determine whether or not
it was strong enough before completing the rest of it-—Mr. Langley decided to
employ part of the time in the construction of a model of one-eighth the linear
dimensions of the large aerodrome, which was to be used in testing a model of
the newly designed launching apparatus described later, and which might also
be flown as a kite in making check measurements on the proper balancing which
should be employed for the large aerodrome.
<span class="xxpn" id="p134">[p134]</span></p>

<p>The perfected launching apparatus which had been used for the steam-driven
models Nos. 5 and 6 (described in Part I, Chapter X <a href="#tocontents">◊</a>) had proved most
satisfactory and reliable, but when the designs were made for a launching apparatus
for the large machine it was found that an exact duplication of the
plan of the small one involved serious difficulties in connection with the construction
of the house-boat, owing to the very considerable weight and size of
the turn-table necessary to permit the aerodrome to be launched in any desired
direction, regardless of the direction in which the houseboat might be pointing
under the influence of the wind and tide. A new design was accordingly made
for a launching apparatus in which the launching car was to run on a track
mounted directly on the turn-table, the launching car supporting the aerodrome
from underneath, instead of being mounted in an inverted position on an overhead
track with the aerodrome depending from it.</p>

<p>From the previous description of the launching apparatus, it will be recalled
that, in order to provide that the aerodrome should drop slightly at the
moment of its release from the car, and thereby avoid all danger of entanglement,
the speed of the launching car at the point at which the aerodrome was released
was purposely made <em class="italic">less</em> than the “soaring speed” of the aerodrome.
Having this feature in mind, when designing the “underneath” launching apparatus,
it was recognized that the danger of the aerodrome becoming entangled
with this form of apparatus could be avoided by making the launching speed
<em class="italic">greater</em> than the velocity which it would be necessary for the aerodrome to
have in order to soar, <em class="italic">provided the balancing was correct and the aerodrome did
soar</em>. Nevertheless, it was deemed unwise to put too much dependence on the
empirical calculations from which the balancing of the large aerodrome would
necessarily be determined, and, therefore, some means seemed necessary for
causing the launching car to drop out of the way immediately upon releasing
the aerodrome. In the new design, more completely described below, in Chapter
IV <a href="#tocontents">◊</a>, this was accomplished by so arranging a portion of the front end of the track
that, at the moment the launching car released the aerodrome, it dropped like a
disappearing gun carriage, leaving the aerodrome free in the air with no possibility
of becoming entangled, provided the aerodrome itself did not drop more
rapidly than an angle of 15 degrees.</p>

<p>A small working model of this launching apparatus, one-eighth the linear
dimensions of that which would be necessary for the large aerodrome, was first
designed and constructed in the shop, the small one-eighth-size model of the
large aerodrome being launched from it into a sheet stretched in front of it to
act as a buffer. When it was found to work very satisfactorily, a large one,
twice this size, was immediately built for use with the steam-driven models Nos.
5 and 6.
<span class="xxpn" id="p135">[p135]</span></p>

<p>These models, Nos. 5 and 6, which had flown so successfully in 1896, had,
during the preceding twelve months, been completely overhauled and thoroughly
tested in preparing them for trials in actual flight. Many pendulum tests were
made on both aerodromes, and it was found after repeated trial that each could
be depended on to show a lift of sixty per cent of its flying weight.</p>

<p>This was more than sufficient for flight, but in order to insure successful
trials and avoid delay no aerodrome was launched until it had shown previously
its ability to generate enough power to maintain for at least two minutes a lift
of at least fifty per cent of the total flying weight.</p>

<p>Models Nos. 5 and 6, having thus proved their readiness for trial in flight,
were accordingly, in April, 1899, taken to Chopawamsic Island, together with
the old “overhead” launching apparatus and the new one above described, and
placed on a small house-boat similar to the one which had been used in 1896.
Two men were detailed for this special work, and were first employed in mounting
the old launching apparatus for a few preliminary tests with it, in order to
make sure that the aerodromes were in proper working order before trying
them on the new “underneath” one. After considerable delay, due to various
causes, this apparatus and the aerodromes were got into proper working condition,
and during June, July and August the following flights were made with
these machines, the record being condensed from the reports made by the writer
to Mr. Langley while he was abroad.</p>

<p>After making a preliminary test of the engines and boiler, with the aerodrome
mounted on benches inside the house-boat, to insure that everything connected
with the power plant was in proper working order, the aerodrome was
mounted on the launching apparatus on top of the house, the various parts
were assembled and everything made ready for a flight. As it was calculated
that this aerodrome would require a soaring speed of something like twenty-five
feet a second, the springs which furnished the motive power for the initial acceleration
of the car were adjusted to the proper tension to cause it to reach a
speed of approximately twenty-three feet a second at the moment of launching.
Everything being in readiness the burners were lighted but worked somewhat
sluggishly at first, so that two minutes were consumed in raising a steam
pressure of 110 pounds. Although this pressure should have been reached within
one minute after lighting the burners, and the extra minute which had been
consumed had made a drain on the supply of fuel and water which should have <span class="xxpn" id="p136">[p136]</span>
been left for consumption during flight, yet it was thought best to launch the
aerodrome, so at 12.37 p. m. the car was released and the aerodrome launched.
The launching apparatus worked perfectly; the aerodrome started off smoothly,
and immediately after being released from the car it dropped slightly and began
to turn to the right. It had been impossible to move the house-boat out
into the stream so as to point the launching apparatus directly into the wind, as
one end had settled slightly on the muddy beach in consequence of the existing
low tide. For this reason it was necessary to launch the aerodrome due south,
while the wind, which was very light, was from the north-northeast, and, therefore,
blowing on its port quarter. The effect of the aerodrome turning to the
right immediately after being launched was that it caused the wind to strike it
to an increasing extent on the port side until, finally, it was going directly with
the wind. It did not, however, continue in this direction, but kept turning to
the right in a circle until it headed directly into the wind, which, now striking
the under instead of the upper surface of the wings, immediately caused the
aerodrome to rise. It continued circling, making three complete circles of approximately
200 feet diameter, dropping slightly when moving with the wind, but
rising when moving against it, until, at the completion of the third circle, it
had altered its path to such an extent that the left front wing touched a tree and
caused the front of the machine to dip a little. It, however, kept up its flight,
but the contact with the tree had so lowered its bow, and apparently also caused
the wings to be twisted to such an extent, that it seemed unable to rise again,
and after making another quarter circle it descended. Although the propellers
were still turning when it struck the water, they had very greatly decreased
their speed, making it apparent that the power had been very greatly reduced
through the exhaustion of the fuel and water supply. The aerodrome did not
sink, but slowly drifted with the current of the creek and was recovered in about
five minutes and brought to the house-boat, where the wings were dismounted
and dried, and the metal parts were carefully wiped off to prevent them from
rusting. The path of this flight is plotted on a portion of a coast-survey chart
and is shown in Plate <a href="#plt033">33</a>.</p>

JUNE 7, 1899 <a class="linka" href="#listplates">◊</a></div>
</div>

<p>This erratic circling at first seemed unaccountable, but on closer examination,
after the aerodrome had been brought into the house-boat, it was found
that the pin which connects the synchronizing gear to the port propeller shaft
had been sheared off. This had evidently happened while the aerodrome was
still on the launching apparatus. The effect of this was to throw the total work
of the water-circulating pump on the starboard engine, thus giving the port engine
less work to do, and consequently making the port propeller run much
faster than the starboard one, and thereby causing the peculiar and erratic circling
of the aerodrome. It is evident that the undulatory motion of the <span class="xxpn" id="p137">[p137]</span>
aerodrome was due to the fact that, when it was moving against the wind, the speed
relative to the air was greater than when it circled so as to go with the wind, and
that this greater relative velocity increased the lifting power of the aerodrome.</p>

<p>The total time of the flight was 57 seconds, and the distance covered was between
2000 and 2500 feet, thus giving a speed of a little less than 30 miles an
hour. Comparing this flight with that of November 28, 1896, made by the same
machine, it will be noted that in the earlier flight the velocity was practically
the same, but that the time of flight and the distance traversed then were nearly
twice as great as in the present case.</p>

<p>A complete record of the details, not only of weight, but also of the position
of the wings, the center of gravity, etc., which show the exact condition of the
aerodrome when it made this flight, will be found in the appendix (Data Sheet,
No. 3).</p>

<p>In the flight of June 7 there was a slight trembling of the aerodrome while
it was in the air, and although this was probably due to the fact that the synchronizing
gear was out of operation on account of the shearing off of one of
the pins which held it, allowing the port engine to run faster than the starboard
one, it was thought possible that some of the trembling might be due to
the “wind-vane” rudder, which had been added to represent the equivalent of
a steering device by which the operator would control the direction of the
large machine. It was decided, therefore, to omit the “wind-vane” rudder in
the present test, but to test the aerodrome with the same equipment of single-tier
wings and Pénaud tail that had been used in the previous flight, the reel
and float being moved to bring the <em class="italic">CG</em> the same as on June 7.</p>

<p>Everything being in readiness, with the launching track pointed south, and
the wind blowing only about
<span class="mixfract">5<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">2</span></span></span>
miles an hour from the southwest, the burners
were lighted and 63 seconds were consumed before the steam pressure rose
to 100 pounds. Although the valve which controlled the burner was open to its
full extent the pressure showed no tendency to rise above 100 pounds, which
was not considered quite high enough to furnish sufficient power for a successful
flight, but as it was desired to determine at once at how low a steam pressure
the aerodrome would fly successfully, it was decided to launch it even at this
pressure. The launching apparatus was accordingly released and the aerodrome
started off, gliding down about three feet immediately after being released, and
then rising again, turning slightly to the right and then heading directly for the
Virginia shore, where it seemed that it would smash itself in the heavy growth
of timber, but when it was about 250 feet from the shore it turned towards the
right and started back towards the island. The wind, however, which was
blowing from its rear, evidently got down the smoke-stack and
put out the fire, <span class="xxpn" id="p138">[p138]</span>
for the aerodrome commenced to descend as soon as it turned its back to the
wind, and came down in the channel of the creek. The path of this flight is
shown by the solid line in Plate <a href="#plt034">34</a>.</p>

<p>The total distance covered, as measured by plotting the course of its flight on
the coast-survey chart, was about 1800 feet, and the length of time of flight was
40 seconds. The aerodrome was immediately recovered and brought into the
house-boat, where it was found that there were still about 1000 grammes of
water and 100 grammes of fuel unused in it, showing conclusively that the fire
had been put out by the wind.</p>

<p>Upon inspection it was found that the aerodrome was uninjured, and although
the burner had not worked at all satisfactorily, yet as the weather was
exceedingly favorable it was decided to make another trial with it immediately,
using the superposed wings.<a id="fnanchor_39" href="#footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></p>

<p>Everything being in readiness the burners were lighted, and 70 seconds
were consumed before the pressure rose to 90 pounds, beyond which it was impossible
to make it rise. Although it was felt certain that 90 pounds was not
sufficient pressure to furnish the power necessary, yet as a storm was approaching
in the distance, it was decided to launch the aerodrome, as it could at least
be determined whether it was properly balanced for the superposed wings.
When a total of 75 seconds had been consumed the car was released and the
aerodrome was launched. The wooden arrangement for pressing down on the
top of the wings to keep the aerodrome from being injured by the wind while
it was on the car had been raised to the proper height for the superposed
wings, but it had not been noticed that the sticks which support this arrangement
had been elevated so much that they would come in contact with the beam
extending across the boat, and from which the launching track was supported.
Just as these sticks reached the cross-beam, however, it was noticed that they
projected about three inches above the lower side of it; but the next moment
they struck it, and although the force with which the car was running broke all
four of them, the blow was sufficient to slow down the car, and thereby cause
the aerodrome to be launched at a very greatly reduced speed; not over one-fifth
of what it should have been. The shock of breaking these sticks evidently
jarred the burners so that the fire was extinguished, for the aerodrome shot
forward for about 25 feet and settled with everything intact, and with its midrod
perfectly horizontal. The aerodrome itself sustained absolutely no injury,
coming down as easily as though it had been lowered by a rope, and would
have been given another trial immediately but for the fact that it was very
late in the afternoon and darkness was rapidly approaching. The data on setting
of wings, tail, etc., are shown on Data Sheet No. 4 (Appendix).

<p>After several days’ delay, due to numerous small but exceedingly annoying
troubles,—such as the leaking of boilers because of defects in the copper tubing,
and the bursting of the air tank, due to its being pumped up to an excessive
pressure, which a defective pressure gauge had failed to indicate,-—Aerodrome
No. 6 was made ready for another trial, and it was decided to test it again with
the superposed wings which had been used in the second experiment of June 13.
The aerodrome was mounted on the “overhead” launching apparatus, which
it will be remembered had been used in all the previous tests, and after 90 seconds
had been consumed in raising a steam pressure of 110 pounds, it was
launched directly into the wind, which was due south. After leaving the launching
car, the aerodrome flew straight ahead for about 75 feet, when it suddenly
turned its bow up into the air at an angle of about 15 degrees, and it seemed
that the machine would be blown back onto the house-boat. However, when the
rear end of the tail was within about 10 feet of the boat, and only about 10 feet
above the water, it suddenly regained its equilibrium and went straight ahead
again in the face of the wind with the guy-posts only about 4 feet above the surface
of the water, flying almost exactly horizontally for a distance of about 100
feet, when the bow again suddenly became elevated. As the aerodrome was so
close to the water, the wind forced it down until the burners were extinguished
by coming in contact with the water. This brought the aerodrome to a standstill
absolutely uninjured, the propellers being several inches above the water
when they quit turning. The aerodrome was brought into the house-boat and
thoroughly dried out, and another trial would have been made with it immediately
but the wind which had been steadily increasing was now blowing something
more than 12 miles an hour, and it was considered best not to attempt experiments
in so strong and gusty a wind, for fear of the wings being broken
by the wind suddenly veering and striking them on the side or rear while the
aerodrome was still on the launching apparatus. The peculiar action of the
aerodrome in the air appeared to be due to the fact that the propellers interfered
more with the lifting power of the rear superposed wings, as they were
then constructed, than they did with the “single-tier” ones. The data on the
setting of the wings, tail, etc., are shown on Data Sheet No. 5 (Appendix).</p>

<p>It was also found after the experiment that one of the workmen, in assembling
the machine on the launching car, had secretly increased the stiffness of
the spring which controls the elasticity of the Pénaud tail. The effect of this
increase in the stiffness of the Pénaud tail might at first thought appear to be
similar to that of moving the center of pressure forward. Upon a closer analysis,
however, it will be seen that the effect is very much greater, as excessive
stiffness of the Pénaud tail not only causes the aerodrome to
elevate its bow, <span class="xxpn" id="p140">[p140]</span>
but requires the overcoming of a strong downward force at the rear, even more
serious than would be caused by placing an extra load at the rear of the machine
without regard to its effect on the balancing. In experiments of this
kind, however, the workmen get certain ideas of their own as to how the work
should be conducted, and it is almost impossible in assembling the aerodrome to
prevent them from making adjustments which are quite different from those
which they have been directed to make, and which have been definitely planned
with a view to determining the effect of slight changes which it is desired shall
not be masked by changes of any kind in other details.</p>

<p>The wind, which had been blowing half a gale all day, gradually quieted
down towards sunset and at five o’clock was very light, blowing only two miles
an hour from the east-southeast. As one of the rear superposed wings had been
injured on the previous day in carrying the aerodrome into the house-boat after
its short and erratic flight, it was decided to use the “single-tier” wings in
this experiment, and also to continue using the “overhead” launching apparatus
for a few more flights. Everything being in readiness, the burners were
lighted and 70 seconds were consumed in raising a steam pressure of 120 pounds,
at which pressure the aerodrome was launched. It started straight ahead, dropping
not more than a foot, and flying on an absolutely even keel for about 800
feet, when it suddenly turned to the left and made a short half circle of about
100 feet diameter, heading for a point about 150 feet east of the house-boat.
When it was about 200 feet from the shore, a sudden gust of wind caught under
the Pénaud tail, raising the rear portion of the aerodrome and causing the bow
to point down at an angle of about 30 degrees. The aerodrome kept this angle
and struck the shallow water only about 20 feet from the shore. The aerodrome
was comparatively uninjured, and another flight would have been made immediately
but for the fact that by the time the aerodrome had been properly inspected
it was quite late, and entirely too dark, and there would have been danger
of losing it in the adjacent marshes, which are difficult to traverse even under
the best conditions of tide and light. The path of this flight is shown by the
dotted line in Plate <a href="#plt034">34</a>.</p>

<p>While the preceding tests had been going on with Aerodrome No. 6, such
time as could be spared for it was spent in getting Aerodrome No. 5 into proper
condition. The copper tubing from which the boilers for both aerodromes were
made was greatly inferior to that which had been used in previous years, and
as this tubing could be procured only by having it specially drawn to order in
France, and as it required several months after placing an order before the <span class="xxpn" id="p141">[p141]</span>
tubing could be delivered, it was necessary to make the best of what was already on
hand. The copper tubing for the boilers which had been used in 1896, after being
carefully annealed and filled with fine sand, could be wound into a perfectly
smooth helix, free from all wrinkles, indentations, and so forth, on the inner
side of the coil. But no amount of care, both in annealing and in winding this
present lot of tubing, would produce a smooth helix, the tubing being badly
wrinkled on the inner side of the coil in spite of every precaution. These
wrinkles, however, were not so much the cause of serious trouble as was the
fact that the tubing was not uniform in quality, each length of it having numerous
rotten spots which did not always show up in the winding, but which
gave way after the boiler had been completed and one or two preliminary runs
in the shop had been made with it. While the effect of such small things cannot
be appreciated from merely reading about them, yet they were the cause
of the most exasperating annoyance and delay, as no sooner had the aerodrome
been gotten into what appeared to be perfect working order than the boiler
would break at one or more points, thus causing a delay which at the moment
would seem to involve not more than a few hours, but before everything was
again in working order would amount to several days.</p>

<p>However, after much perseverance, Aerodrome No. 5 was put in satisfactory
working condition, and on June 27 was launched with its “single-tier”
wings and Pénaud tail. The data on settings of wings, tail, etc., are given on
Data Sheet No. 6. After lighting the burners, 70 seconds were consumed in
raising a steam pressure of 120 pounds. Immediately upon leaving the launching
car the aerodrome started to rise with its bow elevated to an angle of about
15 degrees. It flew straight ahead about 80 feet, when it came backward and
downward and touched the water about 40 feet from the boat. The failure of the
aerodrome to fly properly was evidently due to its not being in proper balance.
The cause of this lack of proper balance was not immediately apparent, but was
very soon detected and will be discussed later on.</p>

<p>After several days of incessant rain and strong winds, which prevented an
experiment, the weather became brighter and the wind quieted down and the
afternoon of June 30 was almost ideal for an experiment. At five o’clock Aerodrome
No. 5, with “single-tier” wings and Pénaud tail, was placed on the
launching apparatus, a few minutes later the burners were lighted, and just as
the propellers started to turn a racking noise was heard. Upon investigation
it was found that the circulating pump had broken. The break was a very small
matter and could have been repaired in an hour, but it was then too late to repair
the damage and get a flight before dark, so the aerodrome was reluctantly
dismounted and the men put to work repairing the broken pump.

<p>The great disadvantage of conducting the experiments at a point forty
miles from the city and the shops was felt at all times. Workmen, even of the
very best class, cannot be kept contentedly at work at a point so far removed
from their homes, even by bringing them to the city on Saturday afternoon and
carrying them back to the experimental grounds the following Monday. Moreover,
it is worse than useless to try to get even as much as one-third the ordinary
amount of work done if there is the slightest excuse for tightening anchor
ropes, watching passing boats, or wasting time on any of the multitudinous small
variations from their usual routine of life.</p>

<p>On July 7, Aerodrome No. 5, equipped with “single-tier” wings and Pénaud
tail, was made ready for a flight in the afternoon. The settings of the
wings, tail, etc., are given on Data Sheet 6. Using the “overhead” launching
apparatus, the aerodrome was launched with a steam pressure of 115 pounds.
Immediately upon being launched its bow rose to an angle of about fifteen degrees
or more, and the aerodrome came backward and downward and touched
the water about three or four feet from the house-boat.</p>

<p>It may be well to recall from what has been said in Part I, Chapter IX <a href="#tocontents">◊</a>, that
Aerodrome No. 5 is the one with the very low thrust line, and in 1896 had its
“separator” several centimetres in front of its center of gravity. When this
aerodrome was overhauled just previous to these experiments, the separator
was moved back to the same relative position as that in Aerodrome No. 6, so that
the gradual depletion of the water supply during flight would not cause it to become
light in front of the center of gravity.</p>

<p>In the launching of Aerodrome No. 5, above described, it showed no tendency
to drop immediately upon leaving the launching ways, but on the contrary
its bow in every case rose almost immediately until it was at an angle of
about fifteen degrees or more. From the photograph (Plate <a href="#plt035">35</a>) it will be noticed
that the wings of the aerodrome are held down by the longitudinal strips,
<em class="italic">A</em>, fastened to cross-beams attached to the launching car. If, now, the launching
speed is too great and the aerodrome tries to rise immediately upon being
released, the front end, which passes from under the launching car before the
rear does, and is thus free to rise, will immediately rise, while the rear cannot
rise until it has passed entirely in front of the car, which being a distance of
several feet requires an appreciable fraction of a second, during which time the
bow of the machine has been able to rise to quite a steep angle. This has the
effect of slowing down the aerodrome so that it does not get quite the proper
chance to start on its flight with a minimum head resistance.</p>

<p>In view of the above facts, it was decided to decrease the speed of the
launching car slightly when using Aerodrome No. 5, so that this matter could
be thoroughly tested out.</p>

<p>The very early morning preceding actual sunrise on July 11 was undoubtedly
as calm as it is possible to find; there was absolutely no breeze stirring
and the water in the river was as smooth as glass as far as one could see. The
anemometer cups were stationary, the wind vane stood absolutely parallel to
the launching apparatus and everything promised a most successful experiment.
After mounting the aerodrome on the “overhead” launching apparatus the
burner was lighted, and while the steam pressure was still rising and the propellers
were revolving faster and faster all the time, there was a snap and they
ceased to turn. The fire, which was burning fiercely, ran the pressure immediately
to 150 pounds. An attempt was at once made to start the propellers
again by giving them an initial turn by hand, it being thought possible that a
sudden gush of water had taken place and, accumulating in one end of the engine
cylinder, had blocked the engine. However, as the engine refused to keep
the propellers going after they were started, and as the pressure was still rising
very rapidly, the burner was shut off and an investigation made. Upon removing
the hull covering, it was found that the connecting rod bearing had broken
off short near the crank pin of the engine, and that it would be necessary to
take the part to Washington in order to repair it, as there were no machine
tools on the house-boat.</p>

<p>After several days of exceedingly bad weather, the conditions grew more
favorable. Late in the afternoon of July 14, Aerodrome No. 5 was again placed
on the “overhead” launching apparatus and prepared for a trial. After lighting
the burners, 95 seconds were required to raise a steam pressure of 120 pounds.
Upon leaving the launching apparatus the aerodrome went directly ahead for
a few feet, but immediately commenced to rise, elevating its bow to an angle of
20 degrees by the time it had travelled 40 feet. With its bow in this position,
it was blown back towards the house-boat and a little to the right of it, and,
when within about 5 feet of the water, suddenly righted itself and started ahead
again, rising all the time and reaching a height of about 20 feet by the time it
had travelled 100 feet. In the meantime the bow had again become elevated to
an angle of about 15 degrees and the aerodrome was blown backwards and downwards
again. Just before reaching the water it started to right itself, but it
had descended so that the front guy-post was in the water, thus destroying its
equilibrium and causing it to settle into the water. The path of this flight is
shown by the peculiar S-shaped line in Plate <a href="#plt034">34</a>.</p>

<p>In the adjustments preliminary to the above trial the Pénaud tail was elevated
to an angle of
<span class="mixfract">7<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">2</span></span></span>
degrees when the aerodrome was stationary in the shop.
This excessive elevation, coupled with the fact that the center of gravity was
also probably a little too far forward, no doubt accounts for the erratic flight.
The data on setting of wings, tail, etc., are given on
Data Sheet No. 7 (Appendix).

</h5>

<p>After several days of exceedingly bad weather the conditions were more favorable
on July 19. Since the last experiment on July 14 the coefficient of elasticity
of the Pénaud tail had been decreased, the rear wings moved back 5 centimetres,
and the “float” so placed that the center of gravity of the machine
was brought to the same position it had had on that day, that is, 2 centimetres
back of the line of thrust. With this arrangement, assuming that the <em class="italic">CP</em> is
over the <em class="italic">CG</em>, we should have an apparent efficiency of the rear wings of 63.6 per
cent, since the distance between <em class="italic">CP</em><sub>fw</sub>, and <em class="italic">CG</em> is 79.7 centimetres, and the distance
between <em class="italic">CP</em><sub>rw</sub> and <em class="italic">CG</em> is 125.3 centimetres. With the adjustment of July
14, the distance between <em class="italic">CP</em><sub>fw</sub> and <em class="italic">CG</em> was 79.7 centimetres, and the distance between
<em class="italic">CP</em><sub>rw</sub> and <em class="italic">CG</em> was 118.3 centimetres, thus allowing for an apparent efficiency
of 67.37 per cent for the rear wings. It will be recalled that in the unsuccessful
flight of July 14 the midrod of the aerodrome was inclined at an angle
of about 20 degrees during most of the time that it was in the air, thus indicating
that the front wings were lifting proportionately more than they should.
On July 14 the Pénaud tail had a negative elevation of 7° 30′, and it required
1240 grammes placed at its center to bring it to the horizontal. On July 19 the
elevation of the tail was changed to 5° and a weaker spring for controlling the
elasticity was substituted, so that it required only 200 grammes placed at the
center of the tail to bring it to the horizontal. A rubber band, of about one-half
the strength of the upper spring, was attached by means of a cord to the
lower guy-post and the lower vertical ribs of the tail, so that the tail would be
elastic both ways. This rubber band was in place and acting to help draw the
tail down when the above measurement of the coefficient of elasticity was made.
A rubber band connected to the lower side of the tail was also used in the
flight of July 14, but it was so very weak, compared to the upper spring, that its
effect was negligible.</p>

<p>The effect of this change in the balancing of the aerodrome, and also the
more considerable effect which the coefficient of elasticity of the tail has on the
balancing, will be immediately noticed from the description of the next flight.
The data on setting of wings, tail, etc. are given on Data Sheet No. 8.</p>

<p>At 3 p. m., the wind having died down, Aerodrome No. 5, equipped with its
“single-tier” wings and Pénaud tail adjusted as above, was placed on the
“overhead” launching apparatus. After lighting the burners, one minute and
thirty seconds were required to raise a steam pressure of 120 pounds. Immediately
upon leaving the launching apparatus, the aerodrome started straight
ahead, dropping about 3 feet by the time it had gone 100 feet; it then rose
with its midrod at an angle of about 6 or 8 degrees, regaining its level very
quickly, however, and making three of these undulations by the time
it had gone <span class="xxpn" id="p145">[p145]</span>
300 feet. It continued straight ahead for another 300 feet and began to circle
to the left, the diameter of the first circle being about 200 feet. As soon as it
started to circle, it rose with its midrod at an angle of about 15 degrees, and
by the time it had made its first half turn it started to descend, coming down to
within 15 feet of the water. As soon, however, as it had completed this first
turn, it again rose, making another half circle, then, upon the completion of
this half turn of the second circle, descended, this time to within 10 feet of the
water, rising again for the third half turn, but again descending to within 2 feet
of the water at the completion of this third circle, and then rising and completing
the first half turn of the fourth circle. By this time, however, it had sunk
so near to the water that the guy-posts caught in the tall grass while it was descending
just before the completion of the fourth circle, thus pulling the aerodrome
down into the water with the propellers still running. The total time
the aerodrome was in the air was 46 seconds. The total number of revolutions
of the propellers was 488, or at the mean rate of 637 R. P. M. Upon examining
the aerodrome, after it was recovered, it was found that there were 925 grammes
of water left in the separator, the fire having been put out by the aerodrome
coming down into the water.</p>

<p>When the aerodrome first commenced to circle during its flight, it was noticed
that the front wing clamps had twisted on the midrod, the left wing being
dipped downwards, and the right one, of course, being elevated, and the peculiar
circling of the aerodrome was undoubtedly due to this fact. The cause of the
wing clamp twisting on the midrod was that one of the workmen forgot to
tighten one of the screws of the wing clamp when the wings were being adjusted
on the aerodrome. But for this unfortunate twisting of the wings, it is probable
that the flight would have been perfectly straight and the distance covered would
have been considerably greater than it was, the total path traversed being about
2600 to 2800 feet, found by plotting the path on the coast-survey chart and measuring
it.</p>

<p>As the proper balancing of both Aerodrome No. 5 and No. 6 had now been
determined with reasonable accuracy, and as much more time had already been
given to the experiments than had been intended, it was decided to dismount
the “overhead” launching apparatus at once and substitute the “underneath”
one, so that it could be immediately determined whether this newer plan for
launching the aerodrome by a car supporting it from underneath would be suitable
for use with the large machine. After a considerable period of exceedingly
bad weather, during which time the change was made in the launching apparatus,
the weather conditions became more favorable on July 27. Aerodrome
No. 6, equipped with “single-tier” wings and Pénaud tail, was mounted on the <span class="xxpn" id="p146">[p146]</span>
“underneath” launching apparatus, and everything was got ready for a flight.
On lighting the burners, they failed to work properly, and, upon investigation,
it was found that the air valve controlling the air pressure on the gasoline
tank, was out of order. While this was being repaired, the wind rapidly increased
in velocity and became very gusty, thus endangering the aerodrome, as
the wings were very liable to be broken by the wind suddenly veering more rapidly
than the house-boat could turn or the turn-table could be moved, and thus
striking the wings from the side and putting an enormous upward pressure on
them, owing to the fact that the diedral angle between them gave to each wing
an elevation of
<span class="mixfract">7<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">2</span></span></span>
degrees from the horizontal. The aerodrome was accordingly
dismounted and everything kept in readiness for a trial, with the hope
that the wind would die down, or at least become steady, but it did not do so
until after dark.</p>

<p>Aerodrome No. 6, equipped with “single-tier” wings and Pénaud tail, was
launched from the “underneath” launching apparatus. There was a dead
calm, the river not showing a ripple; the wind vane pointed to the northeast,
but as the tide was low and the boat was aground, the launching track was pointing
due south. At 7 a. m. the burners were lighted, and 80 seconds were consumed
in raising a steam pressure of 120 pounds. Everything worked perfectly;
the uprights on the car, which initially support the aerodrome and upon its being
released are instantaneously pulled down by rubber springs, as well as the
disappearing part of the track, acted without the slightest hitch. Immediately
upon leaving the launching apparatus, the aerodrome depressed its bow to an
angle of between 3 and 4 degrees and made a direct line for the water. At
this angle it struck just on the opposite side of the channel, about 300 feet from
the house-boat, and while several minor parts, such as guy-posts, were injured
no damage of importance was done. Owing to the difficulty of getting through
the marsh and recovering Aerodrome No. 6, it was found impossible to make
another trial with No. 5 before the wind had increased to a prohibitive velocity.
The path of this flight is shown by the dotted line in Plate <a href="#plt036">36</a>. The data
on setting of wings, tail, etc., are given on Data Sheet No. 9.</p>

<p>The last previous trial of Aerodrome No. 6 was made on June 23, and the
balancing at that time was evidently correct for the settings of the tail which
were then used. The Pénaud tail then had an elevation of
<span class="mixfract">7<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">2</span></span></span>
degrees, and the
coefficient of elasticity was such that 1240 grammes were required at the center
of the tail to deflect it to the horizontal. In the trial above recorded, on July
28, the adjustments of the wings were practically what they were on June 23,
the <em class="italic">CG</em> being moved forward 1 centimetre, but the Pénaud tail had an elevation
of something less than 5 degrees, and the coefficient of
elasticity was such that <span class="xxpn" id="p147">[p147]</span>
200 grammes placed at the center were required to deflect the tail to a horizontal.
It was not intended that the angle of the tail should have been less than 5 degrees,
but it was found that one of the workmen had improperly attached the
fastening wire, and had considerably decreased the angle. This last adjustment
of the Pénaud tail should have been the same as that used on Aerodrome No.
5 in its flight of July 19. The <em class="italic">CG</em> had purposely been moved forward slightly,
but the effect of moving the <em class="italic">CG</em> forward and at the same time decreasing the stiffness
and angle of the tail was shown by this flight.</p>

<p>The above trial not only very clearly emphasizes the importance of carefully
determining what the elasticity of the Pénaud tail should be, but also emphasizes
the fact that even the best workmen, who have had several years of
experience, cannot be relied on in anything which requires that everything be
done <em class="italic">exactly right</em> and not <em class="italic">nearly right</em>.</p>

</h5>

<p>The aerodrome equipped with “single-tier” wings and Pénaud tail was
launched from the “underneath” launching apparatus at 9 a. m., 1 minute and
30 seconds having been required to raise 120 pounds steam pressure. The wind
was from the southeast, with a velocity of 3 miles an hour, and the launching
track was pointed directly into it.</p>

<p>The launching apparatus, with the disappearing track, worked perfectly,
and the aerodrome started straight ahead, dropping slightly at first, but immediately
regaining its level and going ahead, gradually raising its bow to an
angle of about 8 or 10 degrees, and slightly slacking up its speed by the time it
had gone about 300 feet. It then made a circle to the left of a radius of about
75 feet and started back. As soon as it had made this turn it regained its level
and directly regained its speed. But as soon as it had speeded up again it elevated
its bow, which slackened its speed as before. It then again righted itself,
still going in the same direction and crossing the sand-bar on the point of the
island at a height of about 40 feet. As soon as it had crossed the sand-bar, it
again made a circle to the left with a radius of about 75 feet, heading directly
for the house-boat, but when it had got back above the sand-bar it again circled
to the left, passing directly between two tall trees, and barely missing them,
and still circling to the left, when it again reached the opposite side of the sand-bar.
It, however, kept on circling to the left and once more started back towards
the house-boat, this time passing to the left of the trees and again barely
missing them, and completing this, its second, circle over the sand-bar. It then
started due north, heading directly for Quantico, but by this time something
had evidently happened to the burners as the fire went out, and the propellers
gradually slowed up. However, it kept on towards Quantico, gradually descending
on an even keel, and came down in the water at a point about 500 feet <span class="xxpn" id="p148">[p148]</span>
from the sand-bar and about 1000 feet from the house-boat. The propellers
had almost ceased turning when the aerodrome came down into the water, and
it settled almost as quietly as though it had been picked up and placed there,
so that no damage was done to it.</p>

<p>The total time that the aerodrome was in the air was 63 seconds, and the
total length of flight was about 2500 feet. The path of this flight is shown by
the dotted line with the double circle in Plate <a href="#plt036">36</a>. The data on settings of wings,
tail, etc., are given on Data Sheet No. 10.</p>

<p>As soon as the workmen had had their breakfast, Aerodrome No. 5 was
again placed on the launching apparatus, equipped this time with the superposed
wings and Pénaud tail. Upon lighting the burners, it was found that they
did not work properly, a small piece of soot having clogged up the tip of the
vaporizing coil. While this trouble with the burners was being remedied, the
wind increased to such an extent that it was found necessary to remove the
aerodrome from the launching apparatus to prevent its being injured by side
gusts. As it was Saturday and the wind showed no signs of quieting down,
the experiments were discontinued until the next week.</p>

</h5>

<p>After placing the aerodrome on the launching apparatus and getting everything
in readiness for a flight, upon lighting the burners a sudden sheet of
flame shot out of the smoke-stack and so seriously charred three panels of each
of the rear wings that they had to be removed for repairs. The silk covering
of the wings had been coated with a special fire-proofing preparation, but the
intensely hot flame, of course, charred all the silk that it came in contact with.</p>

<p>By the time that the wings had been repaired, and the defect in the burner
which caused the accident had been remedied, a severe storm had arisen, making
it necessary to remove everything to the interior of the boat. While waiting
for the weather to become more suitable, a test of the engine of Aerodrome
No. 5 was made inside of the house-boat. In this test a steam pressure of 140
pounds was obtained, giving 650 R. P. M. of the round-end, 100-centimetre propellers,
which previous tests had shown to mean a thrust of 7480 grammes.
As the flying weight of the aerodrome was now 14,104 grammes, the thrust obtained
would correspond to a lift of 53 per cent of the flying weight, which
was maintained in this test for 90 seconds.</p>

<p>As the <em class="italic">CG</em> of Aerodrome No. 5 seemed to be a little too far forward in the
flight of July 28, it was decided to change it slightly, and it was moved back 4
millimetres.</p>

</div>

<p>A trial run in the house-boat was also made on Aerodrome No. 6, while
waiting for the weather to become more suitable, but, unfortunately, the result
of this test was disastrous. The aerodrome had been placed on trestles and <span class="xxpn" id="p149">[p149]</span>
held down to the floor by wires fastened to the cross-frame. In the midst of
the test one of the wires slipped, allowing the aerodrome to push forward and
thus permitting the propellers to come in contact with the wires which held
it to the floor. Both propellers were entirely demolished and the cross-frame
was broken off short just at the right-hand engine. The disaster was entirely
due to the carelessness of one of the workmen in tightening one of these wires,
a further example of the extreme heedlessness of workmen, even in the most
important details, which concern the very existence of the machine.</p>

<h5>
<span class="smcap">A<span class="smmaj">UGUST</span></span>

<span class="smmaj">NO.</span> 5
</h5>

<p>After the very satisfactory trial of Aerodrome No. 5 in the shop two days
previous, it was hoped, now that the weather had become suitable, that a good
flight with the superposed wings would be obtained. The aerodrome, equipped
with these wings, was accordingly placed on the launching apparatus and the
burners were lighted, but they refused to work properly, a steam pressure of only
80 pounds being obtained. After much delay the burners were finally got to
work properly, but the wind had increased in velocity to such an extent that it
was necessary to remove the aerodrome to the interior of the house-boat. As
the wind continued to increase in velocity it was decided to make another trial
of the aerodrome inside of the house-boat. Upon doing this it was very soon
found that there was a small leak in the front turn of one of the coils of the
boiler, and the steam from this played directly against the burner, causing it to
work intermittently. A new coil was substituted, and after some adjustment a
very excellent run was obtained, the steam pressure reaching 130 pounds and
the propellers making 654 R. P. M.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the wind quieted down and the aerodrome, equipped with
superposed wings, was again placed on the launching apparatus. The burners
were lighted but again refused to work properly, the vaporizing tip being
stopped up with soot. This caused the burner to “flood,” which sent a sheet
of flame through the stack and burned the rear right wing.</p>

<p>A new wing was substituted, the burner tip was cleaned out and everything
was again put in readiness for a flight. Upon lighting the burners, 1 minute and
58 seconds were required to raise 120 pounds steam pressure. The underneath
launching apparatus, with the disappearing track, worked perfectly, the aerodrome
dropping slightly, but going straight ahead. It, however, continued to descend
for a distance of about 100 feet, the bow being elevated about 5 degrees.
The bow then became horizontal, the aerodrome rising slightly at the same time,
but going only about 50 feet farther, when it again started to descend slightly,
and finally settled gently on the water between 300 and 500 feet from the house-boat,
with its bow elevated about 3 degrees. There was a hiss as the hull
touched the water, showing that the fire was still burning and making it <span class="xxpn" id="p150">[p150]</span>
improbable that the failure of the flight was due to lack of power. The data on
settings of wings, tail, etc., are given on Data Sheet No. 11.</p>

<p>The speed of the launching car, one foot in front of the point at which
the aerodrome was released, was twenty feet a second, as shown by the carbon
record sheet carried by the launching car and moved in front of a tuning fork
which had been set in vibration.</p>

<p>The aerodrome, being uninjured in the previous flight, was again placed on
the “underneath” launching apparatus, and before attaching the wings a short
run was made in order to see that everything was in proper working condition.
As everything seemed to be all right, the wings and tail were immediately adjusted
for another trial. As the bow was slightly elevated in the previous trial,
it was thought best to bring the <em class="italic">CG</em> a little farther forward, and this was accordingly
done. As the aerodrome also seemed to drop slightly in leaving the
launching car in the above trial, the tension of the launching springs was slightly
increased so as to increase the velocity at the moment of release.</p>

<p>Just as the sun was setting the aerodrome was again launched, 1 minute and
30 seconds having been required to raise 120 pounds steam pressure, but the
pressure was rising very rapidly at the moment of launching. There was an
absolutely dead calm prevailing, the river being as smooth as glass. The launching
apparatus, with the disappearing track, worked perfectly. Immediately
upon being released the aerodrome went straight ahead, with its midrod horizontal,
but gradually glided downward as though the wings had very little lifting
power, and settled in the water about 200 feet from the house-boat. The velocity
of the launching car, 1 foot before the aerodrome was released, was 22
feet a second, as shown by the carbon record sheet.</p>

<p>In the above trials of the superposed wings, the conditions of the wind and
of the aerodrome were certainly as favorable as could be expected. There was
as much power being furnished by the engine as had been furnished in the previous
flights with the “single-tier” wings, and the balancing of the aerodrome
was exceedingly good. The superposed wings, unquestionably, had a fair trial
and proved inferior to the “single-tier” ones, for they had a supporting surface
of 2.75 square feet to the pound, whereas with the “single-tier” wings
there was approximately 2 square feet to the pound. The decreased lifting
power of the superposed wings seems to be another confirmation of the results
of the Allegheny experiments with the “plane-dropper.”<a id="fnanchor_40" href="#footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></p>

<p>As more time had already been given to these tests than it seemed well to <span class="xxpn" id="p151">[p151]</span>
spend on them at that time, owing to the pressure of the work of construction
for the large machine, it was deemed best to discontinue them for the time being,
and as soon as time could be found for it, to construct a set of wings with
superposed surfaces, using only two surfaces and making their distance apart at
least equal to or greater than their width.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that the prime object in making these tests was to
obtain data for use in the balancing of the large aerodrome and in constructing
a launching apparatus for it. The chief deductions drawn from them were:
First: That it would be best to construct the first set of wings for the large machine
on the “single-tier” plan, and later to make a set of superposed ones,
should further experiments with new designs develop a type of superposed surfaces
which gave as good lifting power as the “single-tier” ones. Second:
That the proportioning of the coefficient of elasticity of the Pénaud tail should
be given as careful attention as the setting of the wings. Third: That the “underneath”
launching apparatus was equally as good as the “overhead” one,
and that both worked as well as could be desired; and, fourth, that while short
periods of calm weather might be expected during some part of the day on a
portion of the days of each month, yet the most favorable conditions were more
apt to be met with between the first break of day and the actual rising of the
sun, or from an hour preceding sunset until darkness actually came.</p>

<p>It will be noted that while considerable delay was experienced in making
these tests, nearly all of it was due to the very delicate adjustments required
in the power-generating apparatus of the aerodrome, but it should also be noted
that when these adjustments were accurately made the models operated exceedingly
well, and could be depended upon to give good flights of sufficient duration
to permit a careful study of their action while in the air.</p>

<p>In the experiments of June 27 and July 7, above described, the aerodrome
immediately after leaving the launching apparatus began to rise with its midrod
pointed upward at an angle of about 15 degrees. From Data Sheet No. 6,
which gives in detail the important data as to the settings of the wings, the
elasticity of the Pénaud tail,<a id="fnanchor_41" href="#footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a>
etc., we note that the tail had a negative angle of
<span class="mixfract">7<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">2</span></span></span>
degrees, and that the spring which held it at this angle was of such a stiffness
that it required 1240 grammes placed at its center of figure to depress it to
the horizontal. It will also be noticed that the position of the front and
rear <span class="xxpn" id="p152">[p152]</span>
wings relative to the center of gravity of the machine was not the same as that
which existed at the time of the very successful flights of 1896, as shown by Data
Sheet No. 1 of No. 5, May 6, 1896. When the elasticity of the tail was adjusted
before making this test it was thought that it was made the same as in the experiments
of 1896, though accurate data as to the exact amount of this elasticity
had, unfortunately, not been kept.</p>

<p>A slight change had also been made in the method employed of attaching
the Pénaud tail to the machine. In 1896 the tail was attached to the machine
by means of a flat piece of wood (hickory) which had been steamed and bent to
the proper extent to cause the rudder to have a negative angle of about 5 degrees,
but no accurate note was made of its angle or stiffness, so that in 1899
no data were available as to exactly what the angle had been or how stiff the
spring was. Owing to the fact that wood not only warps and twists, but also
that any piece which has been steamed and bent gradually loses a certain amount
of its curvature, it was decided in 1898 to change this method of attaching the
tail, the wooden spring being replaced by a coiled steel spring attached to an
upper guy-post and connected to the tail by a bridle wire fastened to the center
of figure of the tail.</p>

<p>After the experiment of July 7, 1899, a lower spring, consisting of small
rubber bands, was connected by a wire to the lower part of the rudder and
fastened to the guy-post, thereby more nearly reproducing the conditions obtained
when using a wooden spring, which, of course, tends to return the rudder
to its normal position when it is displaced in either direction. After attaching
this lower spring to the rudder, the experiment of July 14 was made, and it
was found that the aerodrome still flew with its midrod pointed upward at a
very steep angle. It was, therefore, felt certain that the upper spring on the
rudder was too stiff, and that it should not require so much as 1240 grammes
to bring it to the horizontal. This spring was, therefore, replaced by a weaker
one, and the angle of the rudder was also decreased until it had a negative angle
of only 5 degrees and required only 200 grammes placed at its center of figure
to bring it to the horizontal. From the description of the flight of July 19, it
will be seen that these changes immediately corrected the tendency of the aerodrome
to point its nose upward at such a sharp angle, and it will be later seen
that after a further slight adjustment the flight of July 29 was made, in which
the proper balancing was obtained and the aerodrome made a good horizontal
flight.</p>

<p>After these preliminary tests with the “overhead” launching apparatus,
it was dismounted and the “underneath” one substituted and the experiments
of July 28, 29 and August 3 were made. Everything connected with this “underneath”
launching apparatus worked perfectly from the start and four flights
of the aerodromes were made using it.</p>

</div>

<div class="xxpn" id="p153">[p153]</div>

<p>It will be recalled that in “Experiments in Aerodynamics” Mr. Langley
made tests of the soaring speed, etc., of surfaces when superposed. In many
of his experiments with rubber-driven models, he also employed superposed surfaces.
During the summer of 1898 several forms of superposed surfaces, of
a proper size for use on the steam-driven models Nos. 5 and 6, were constructed
and were tested under as nearly as possible the same conditions as
would exist when used on the aerodrome, by mounting the surfaces on the whirling-table
and measuring their soaring speed, lift, drift, etc., to determine just
what arrangement of surfaces gave the greatest lifting effect with the least
resistance. Two of the forms which were tested are shown in Plate <a href="#plt037">37</a>, Figs.
1 and 2, and Plates <a href="#plt064">64</a> and
<a href="#plt065">65</a>. At the conclusion of these tests, it was decided to
construct a set of surfaces on the plan shown in Plates <a href="#plt064">64</a>
and <a href="#plt065">65</a>, and to have
them ready for use on either of the models Nos. 5 and 6. These surfaces were
taken to Chopawamsic Island in April, 1899, when all of the other aerodromic
material was first carried there. It was planned to make some tests with them
to determine whether or not it would be best to use superposed surfaces on the
large aerodrome or to follow the plan of “single-tier” ones, which had the
great advantage of having already proved their worth in the successful flights
of the models. On August 3, Aerodrome No. 5, equipped with these superposed
surfaces, was launched. It will be noted from Data Sheet No. 11 that the superficial
area of the superposed surfaces was considerably greater than that provided
by the “single-tier” ones, and on the assumption of the same efficiency per unit of
surface in both cases, the aerodrome should have soared at a less speed and required
less power when using the superposed surfaces. The results obtained,
however, were just the reverse, the aerodrome being unable to sustain itself when
using the superposed surfaces, whereas with the “single-tier” ones it was evident
that a slight excess weight might easily have been carried without preventing
the aerodrome from soaring properly. While it was felt that these tests were not
entirely conclusive as to the superior lifting power of the “single-tier” surfaces,
yet as the engine builder was constantly promising, each time with increased
emphasis, that he would within less than a fortnight deliver the engine
for the large aerodrome, and that it would develop even more power than the
specifications called for, it was deemed best to cease the experiments with the
models and concentrate all effort on the completion of the large aerodrome
frame and the construction of a set of “single-tier” supporting surfaces for
it. It was recognized from the first that the “single-tier” supporting surfaces
lacked the rigidity which could be secured by the truss construction afforded by
the superposed plan, yet these models, which were the only machines in the
history of the world that had ever flown successfully, had been equipped with
“single-tier” surfaces; and the experience so dearly bought during the long <span class="xxpn" id="p154">[p154]</span>
years of development of these models had taught the very valuable lesson that
in work of this kind where we have no margin on anything, but everything has
to be calculated on the “knife-edge” basis, it is an exceedingly unwise thing to
introduce any modification from what has been proved to be satisfactory, unless
such modification is absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>The principal object in building the one-eighth size model of the large aerodrome,
as mentioned in the first part of this chapter, was to determine by actual
experiment whether the new form of “underneath” launching apparatus,
which had just been designed, was likely to prove as satisfactory as the original
“overhead” type, which had been used in the successful flights of the models in
1896. Yet after it was completed this aerodrome was found so very strong and
stiff, even though roughly constructed by merely tying the joints of the tubing
together with wires and soldering over the joints, that it was decided to equip
it with power, if a suitable form of power could be found which could be easily
applied. Just at this time liquid air as a motive power was attracting considerable
attention all over the country, and attempts were made to procure a
small power plant for operation by liquid air. After devoting considerable time
to the matter it was found impossible to do anything with it just at that time, as
the liquified air could not be obtained in Washington, and one of the chief experimenters
in New York, who had been given a commission to make certain experiments
at his plant, so continuously delayed beginning them that it was found
necessary to give up the idea.</p>

<p>However, after the completion of the tests of the launching apparatus some
experiments were made in flying the model as a kite. For this purpose a mast
twenty feet high was constructed and so arranged that it could be mounted at
the center of a small power launch. The model aerodrome was flown by a cord
connected to it by a bridle, the cord passing over a swivel pulley on top of the
mast and down into the boat, whence it could be played out or hauled in as
occasion required. By heading the launch into the wind it was possible to secure
sufficient relative velocity to cause the model to support itself and a number
of tests were made in this way. It was found that when the bridle was attached
at the point at which the propellers would deliver their thrust, had they
been in use and driven by power, the model flew exceedingly well, maintaining
its equilibrium even during very strong gusts. Owing to the rolling produced
by waves from the large boats which were continually passing in the part of
the river where these tests were made, the power launch was often in danger of
being upset by its tall mast; and finally, when the tests were just reaching the
point where accurate information was being obtained on the balancing of the
model, a sudden rolling of the boat caused the mast to snap off while the model
was in the air. Before it could be picked up from the water a passing boat had
swamped it and it was lost in the river.
<span class="xxpn" id="p155">[p155]</span></p>

<p>Although the model was, as has been said, rudely constructed and, therefore,
did not represent a serious loss, yet the pressure of the more important
construction work for the large machine prohibited the construction of another
rough model for continuing these kite experiments, which it was felt could not
at best be more than approximate indications of the general stability of the machine
under practical conditions.</p>

<h3 title="Chapter IV. House-boat and Launching Apparatus.">CHAPTER IV<br />
HOUSE-BOAT AND LAUNCHING APPARATUS</h3></div>

<p>The use of a house-boat seemed to Mr. Langley so indispensable in former
years in making open-air tests of the models that he decided from the outset,
though advised by the writer against doing so, to use the same plan on a much
larger scale in connection with the large aerodrome. Aside from its supposed
utility as a convenient and apparently safe place from which to launch the aerodrome,
the house-boat was valuable as a portable workshop for making necessary
repairs and as a temporary storehouse for the apparatus, thereby saving
much packing and unpacking. It also provided sleeping quarters for the
workmen.</p>

<p>It was early seen that this plan would require a boat at least 60 by 40 feet,
which could be built only at a large initial cost. But as the experience with models
had so firmly convinced Mr. Langley that it was necessary not only that the
aerodrome be launched over the water, but also at a considerable height above it,
and from a station that commanded all points of the compass, he decided to
adopt this plan for the large aerodrome, and designs for such a boat were accordingly
made in the latter part of 1898.</p>

<p>In order to insure the completion of this house-boat by the time the aerodrome
was expected to be ready for trial, it was built under contract. Immediately
after its delivery in May, 1899, work was begun on the superstructure
which carried the launching track. This superstructure was a considerable undertaking,
involving a turn-table weighing about 15 tons, supported on a double
circular track, and this track in turn was supported entirely from the side walls
of the house to avoid having columns in the middle of the floor. From the photographs,
Plate <a href="#plt038">38</a>, Figs. 1, 2 and 3, it will be seen that the entire superstructure
was supported by three trussed girders extending across the boat above the
roof and carried by vertical posts built into the side walls of the house. The
turn-table was 48 feet square and the launching track carried by it was 5 feet

HOUSE-BOAT AND LAUNCHING APPARATUS, 1899
<a class="linka" href="#listplates">◊</a></div>
</div>

<p>In making tests of the models, it had been the practice to carry the main
body of the aerodrome up a ladder to the upper works of the boat, the wings
being also carried up in the same manner. As the large aerodrome was expected
to weigh at least 640 pounds, of which 350 pounds would be the steel
frame with its undetachable parts, such as the engine and its appurtenances, it
was seen that something more effective than a ladder would need to be provided
for getting the aerodrome from the interior of the boat to the launching track <span class="xxpn" id="p157">[p157]</span>
above. It was therefore decided to place the upper works of the boat rather
nearer the rear end than the front, thus leaving a space over the front end of
the house through which a large trap-door might be cut in the roof, and it was
thought that in this way the aerodrome might be passed up to the launching
track by the use of suitable ropes and pulleys. The upper works were so arranged,
and a sliding trap-door was provided in the roof, but more intimate
knowledge of the difficulties of handling so large and heavy a frame made it
certain, even before the aerodrome was ever placed upon the house-boat, that
it would be impossible to transport it to the upper works by passing it through
the trap-door. A different plan was then resorted to. A very large door was
constructed at the rear end of the house, through which the completely assembled
frame could be carried in a level position and placed upon a large raft,
consisting of a lattice flooring over pontoons, moored at the rear end of the
boat, as clearly seen in Plate <a href="#plt038">38</a>. In order to raise the aerodrome frame from
the raft to the upper works, a large, but light, mast and boom, with suitable
stays were provided. As the wings, when mounted in their proper position
on the aerodrome, would be interfered with by such a mast, the mast and boom
were so devised as to be capable of rapid erection and dismounting,
only five minutes being necessary for either operation. In Plate <a href="#plt038">38</a> the mast and boom
are seen in position in Fig. 3, while in Figs. 1 and 2 they have been dismounted.</p>

<p>The construction of the launching track and car was begun in November,
1899, but their completion was long delayed, as they were frequently put aside
for the more immediately important parts of the work. Moreover, the arrangement
of the struts and clutch of the launching car depended entirely on the form
and dimensions of the frame of the aerodrome, which could not be entirely decided
until a proper engine had been secured and tested in the frame to determine
what modifications of it were necessary. In the spring of 1902, however,
the launching car was entirely finished and a number of tests of the large engine
were made in the shop with the frame mounted in position on the car.</p>

<p>From the description of the “overhead” launching apparatus (Part I,
Chapter X <a href="#tocontents">◊</a>) which had proved so successful in the tests of the models, both in
1896 and in the later experiments of 1899, it will be recalled that the essential
features of it were a track and a light car with three hinged struts which extended
below the body of the car, and against which suitable co-acting bearing
points attached to the frame of the aerodrome were tightly drawn by means of
a clutch which gripped a special fitting fastened to the aerodrome frame near
the central point of its length. After the engine of the aerodrome had been
started and got to running at full speed, the car was released and moved forward
along its track by the combined force of the thrust of the propellers and
the pull of the coiled launching springs. Just before the car reached the forward
end of the track, a cam at this point caused the clutch to open and release <span class="xxpn" id="p158">[p158]</span>
the aerodrome, which immediately dropped slightly, as it had purposely not
quite reached a speed sufficient to cause it to soar. This slight drop of the
aerodrome, even if it were only a fraction of an inch, made it possible for the
hinged struts, against which it had been held by the clutch, to be folded up by
their special springs against the floor of the car, thus leaving the aerodrome
free in the air without danger of entanglement.</p>

<p>The struts referred to above were three in number, two being placed near
the rear and one at the center of the front of the car. The use of three points
of support had the advantage of furnishing a rather rigid foundation against
which the frame could be tightly drawn by means of the clutch-hook without
risk of straining it. In designing the “underneath” launching apparatus, which
was very thoroughly tested in the experiments with the models in the summer of
1899, the plan of having three struts with the aerodrome drawn tightly against
them by means of a central clutch-hook was continued with most satisfactory
results.</p>

<p>When the position of the struts on this launching apparatus had been
changed so as to permit it to be used for the quarter-size model, it was found, in
making shop tests of the engine with the aerodrome mounted on the launching
car, that, owing to the greater vibration produced by the gasoline engine, the
three points of suspension did not hold the model in a sufficiently rigid manner.
It became necessary, therefore, to use four struts, the two rear ones being left
as before, and the single one in front being replaced by two interconnected ones
arranged similarly to those in the rear. After making this change no difficulty
was found in holding the aerodrome rigidly against the struts, and this modification
was therefore immediately introduced in the designs for the large launching
car which was already under construction.</p>

<div class="caption left">PL. 39. METHOD OF ATTACHING GUY-WIRES
TO GUY-POSTS TO RELIEVE TORSIONAL STRAIN
<a class="linka" href="#listplates">◊</a></div>
</div>

<p>Experience, both with models 5 and 6, and with the quarter-size model, had
also demonstrated the necessity of providing some means whereby the aerodrome
frame would be relieved of the torsional strains produced upon it by a
side wind striking the under surface of the wings when the aerodrome was
mounted on the car preparatory to a test. The means for preventing these torsional
strains in the case of the models, when “overhead” type of launching
car was used, has been described in Chapter X of Part I <a href="#tocontents">◊</a>. However, with
the “underneath” type of launching car, a different means was necessary. A plan,
in which outriggers projected from the body of the car and wires running from
these outriggers up to the main ribs of the wings, with means for releasing
the wires just before the car reached the end of the track, was used with the
“underneath” car in the tests of models 5 and 6 in the summer of 1899, but the
outriggers were frequently deranged by the sudden stopping of the car at the
end of the run and they were replaced by a simpler arrangement. In this plan
the torsional strains were relieved by providing, at the forward and rear ends <span class="xxpn" id="p159">[p159]</span>
of the car, smaller hinged uprights furnished in their upper part with a small
slot into which a pin projected from the bottom of the forward and rear guy-posts,
respectively. The guy-wires from wings being connected to the
lower ends of the guy-posts the torsional strain produced by a side wind was
immediately transmitted from the wings through the guy-wires to the guy-post,
whence it was transmitted to the car itself, and thus prevented from acting on
the metal frame of the aerodrome, as shown in Plate <a href="#plt039">39</a>. These additional short
struts for taking up the torsional strain were first added to the small launching
car in 1901, and in the succeeding tests made with the quarter-size model
no trouble of any kind was indicated as likely to be caused by them. As it was
these extra struts which were directly responsible for the accident in the launching
of the large aerodrome October 7, 1903, at the time of its first trial, and possibly
also for that on December 8, 1903, at the time of the second trial, special
attention is here called to them.</p>

<p>The length of travel which could be provided for the launching car in the
case of the large aerodrome, as well as in that of the models was necessarily
very limited, owing to the fact that the track had to be constructed on the top of
the house of the boat. It was therefore necessary, in order that the aerodrome
might attain a speed sufficient for soaring before being launched, to keep the
weight of the launching car as small as possible, a given spring tension being
capable of accelerating a given mass a definite amount in a given length of
travel. With a heavier launching car the spring tension would have to be increased.
Moreover, since the blow which would be struck when the car was suddenly
stopped at the end of the track, would depend on its mass as well as its
velocity, there was an additional reason for trying to keep the weight of the
car as small as possible.</p>

<p>While it was found perfectly feasible to keep the weight of the launching
car for the model low enough for practical purposes, in designing the launching
car for the large aerodrome it was only by eliminating all flooring of the car
and providing merely a box frame with necessary cross-braces, that its weight
was kept within what appeared reasonable limits. Even then the blow which it
would strike when it reached the end of the track was found by calculation to
be exceedingly formidable.</p>

<p>Referring to the drawings of Plate <a href="#plt040">40</a>, Figs. 1, 2 and 3, it will be seen that
the large launching car consisted essentially of two parallel longitudinal side
members 6 inches deep by 1.5 inches thick by 19 feet long, connected by three
main sets of cross-members: one set near the rear, at the point at which the
rear struts for supporting the aerodrome were mounted; a second rather heavier
set about the middle of its length, at the point where the strut which carried
the clutch-hook was mounted; and a third near the front, at the point where the
front struts were mounted. Projecting from the forward end of each of the <span class="xxpn" id="p160">[p160]</span>
longitudinal side members were piston rods, on which were mounted leather-cup
pistons, which co-acted with buffer cylinders fixed at the extreme front of the
track to absorb the blow when the car reached them at the end of its travel.
The car was supported on each side by means of four hangers (Figs. 4 and 5)
which carried grooved wheels having ball-bearings and running on a steel track
consisting of flat plates fastened on the side of the timbers of the launching
track. On the extreme lower point of these hangers were small guide pulleys,
so placed as to be just below and out of contact with a guard rail on the side
of the launching track, thus preventing any possibility of the launching car being
raised from the track either during its forward motion or by a side wind
striking underneath the wings.</p>

FRONT END OF TRACK JUST PREPARATORY TO LAUNCHING AERODROME
<a class="linka" href="#listplates">◊</a></div>
</div>

<p>On the large launching car the arrangement of the struts against which the
bearing points of the frame were tightly drawn by the clutch was similar in all
respects to that used on the model car, there being only slight differences in
details. The details of the uprights on which the bearing points of the aerodrome
frame rested are clearly shown in Figs. 6, 7, 8, and 9 of Plate <a href="#plt040">40</a>. From
the photographs (Plate <a href="#plt041">41</a>, Figs. 1, 2, and 3) which show the large frame
mounted on the launching car, the general arrangement of the struts and the
clutch-hook can be readily seen; and from Plate <a href="#plt042">42</a>, Figs. 1, 2, and 3, which show
in detail most of the important features of the clutch-post and its clutch, a very
good idea of the size of the different parts may be had by observing that the
distance from the fulcrum of each half of the hook to the pin by which it was
connected through the universal joint to the vertical rods is five inches. As
previously stated, this clutch-hook gripped the lower pyramid and pulled the
bearing points of the frame firmly against the forward and rear struts of the
launching car, and in launching the aerodrome the triggers arranged on the
bottom of the car, which at the proper time pull on the vertical rods and thereby
force the two halves of the clutch-hook apart, are so arranged that they strike
a cross-beam at the front end of the track one inch before the triggers, which
keep the struts from being pulled down by their springs, which tend to fold
them up and force them down against the car. The triggers, which prevent the
struts from being folded down, strike a cross-beam in the track one foot before
the buffer pistons on the end of the car begin to enter the buffer cylinders at
the end of the track, and, consequently, one foot before the folding prop, which
supports the front end of the track, is knocked out by the car striking a special
trigger which allows this folding prop to swing forward when the front end of
the track folds down to insure that the aerodrome will not become entangled
with the car, even though the aerodrome be not quite up to soaring speed at the
moment of launching. The manner in which this front end of the track folds
down can be very readily seen by comparing Plate <a href="#plt043">43</a> with Plate <a href="#plt095">95</a> of Chapter
XII <a href="#tocontents">◊</a>, the former showing the front end of the track in horizontal position, with <span class="xxpn" id="p161">[p161]</span>
the aerodrome at the extreme rear end just preparatory to launching, and the
latter showing the front end of the track folded down with the hinged prop
standing outward in its downward path and the aerodrome just launched. These
photographs will be more particularly referred to later, but attention is here
called to them so that the description immediately following may be more
easily understood.</p>

<p>Although this method of launching the aerodrome seemed to Mr. Langley,
both theoretically and from the experience with the models, to be a satisfactory
and feasible plan, there were two very important respects in which it seemed
from the very first open to objection. In the first place, it was necessary that
the aerodrome should be launched as nearly at its soaring speed as possible,
because either an excess or deficiency of speed interfered to some extent with
the equilibrium of the machine. So many factors were involved in the determination
of what this final velocity should be that it seemed almost impossible
to be sure of the results until at least one test of the aerodrome had been made.
In the second place it was not known whether the rapid acceleration of the car
would seriously interfere with the equilibrium of the aviator.</p>

<p>In reference to the first question it was, of course, known that a freely
falling body acquires a speed of 32 feet per second at the end of the first second
after having fallen a distance of 16 feet. It was proposed to launch the
aerodrome at approximately 35 feet per second; and, since the distance over
which the car would pass in acquiring this speed was approximately 60 feet, the
rate of acceleration would, of course, be less than that for a freely falling body.
The conditions in the two cases, however, are quite different. In the case of
the freely falling body there is the constant force of gravity which causes the
acceleration. In the case of the aerodrome the car is initially standing still but
ready to be acted upon by the combined force of the thrust of the propellers
and the tension of the springs. The propeller thrust is approximately 450 pounds
at the moment of releasing the car, while the spring tension adds approximately
400 pounds more pull, giving a total pull of 850 pounds acting on the car at the
start. The weight of the aerodrome including the aeronaut being approximately
850 pounds, and the weight of the car being approximately 450 pounds, the total
weight to be accelerated is 1300 pounds. The resistance of the car and the aerodrome
is zero at the moment the car is released, and increases approximately as
the square of the velocity until it reaches approximately 300 pounds at the soaring
speed of the aerodrome; while on the other hand the spring tension decreases
uniformly from 400 pounds at the start to approximately 76 pounds at
the end of the track, and the thrust due to the propellers decreases from 450
pounds at the start to approximately 250 pounds at the moment of launching.
Consequently, it is in a general way clear that the rate of acceleration of the
aerodrome and car decrease, probably in a geometric ratio,
the rate of acceleration <span class="xxpn" id="p162">[p162]</span>
at the moment of launching the aerodrome being much less than that of a
freely falling body. Since so many factors enter into the problem no confidence
was felt in calculations as to what the rate of acceleration would be. It was,
therefore, decided to determine it experimentally at the same time that tests
were made on the car to determine what spring tension would be necessary to
enable the aerodrome and car to acquire soaring speed by the time they reached
the end of the track.</p>

<p>It was obviously impossible to make this initial test with the aerodrome
mounted on the launching car, as the aerodrome would certainly wreck both itself
and the car were it allowed to remain fastened when the car was stopped
at the end of the track. It was, therefore, decided to make the tests by mounting
on the car boards which would have a head resistance equal to that of the
aerodrome. In order to minimize as much as possible the blow due to the
car striking the buffers at the end of the track, the car had been made as
light as possible. On this account it was felt to be unwise to risk adding to it
a weight of 850 pounds to represent the aerodrome, and supplying an additional
spring tension to represent the thrust of the propellers, as the total effect
of the added weight and the added pull would certainly completely demolish the
car. By calculation it was found that the omission of the 850 pounds weight of
the aerodrome and the spring tension to represent the thrust of the propellers
would practically counterbalance each other; and that if sufficient spring tension
were provided to cause the car, with the light boards representing the head resistance
of the aerodrome, to reach the soaring speed by the time it arrived at
the end of the track, it would be safe to assume that this spring tension would
be sufficient for use in launching the aerodrome.</p>

<p>The method of measuring the final speed of the launching car for the models
consisted in fastening a strip of smoked paper to the launching car in such
a position that it was drawn past a stylus fastened to the end of a vibrating
tuning fork placed at the end of the track. This had proved perfectly successful,
but it gave a record merely of the final speed attained by the car at the moment
of launching the aerodrome. In the case of the large aerodrome it was desirable
to have a record of the speed of the car during the first few feet, and
also at several other points in its travel down the launching track, and the more
numerous these points the better. Short strips of copper were accordingly
placed every twelve inches along the length of the track, and these were connected
by a wire to one terminal of a small electric battery. Mounted on the car,
in such a way that it would be drawn across these contact strips, was a copper
brush arranged to make continuous contact with another wire stretched along
the track, this second wire being connected to the other terminal of the electric
battery and having in its circuit the magnet which actuated a pen on a chronograph.
Since the rate of revolution of the chronograph barrel was known, the <span class="xxpn" id="p163">[p163]</span>
distance between the marks which the magnet would cause the pen to make when
its circuit was closed by the brush on the car passing across the contact strips
on the track would give correct measures of the time consumed by the car in
passing over each twelve inches of its travel. Upon test, however, it was found
impossible to get the chronograph magnets to work rapidly enough to respond
to the very rapid opening and closing of the circuit after the car had passed
over the first one-quarter of its length of travel. As a large part of the slowness
of action seemed to be due to the weight of the fountain pens, they were replaced
by small glass tubes drawn out to a fine point and containing a small
amount of ink. These seemed, however, to be still too heavy to respond to the
rapid closing of the circuit unless the contacts were made unduly long. The
contacts were finally made three inches long and placed only every three feet
along the track, but just as these contacts were completed and placed in position
the clock-work of the chronograph itself became deranged. Before it could
be repaired, the tests were discontinued, as everything was in readiness for the
boat to proceed down the river where the actual tests in free flight were to be
made. Tests of the final speed of the car were, however, made by the tuning-fork
method, and the springs were adjusted until their tension was sufficient
to cause the car to attain a speed of thirty-five feet a second at a point three
inches in front of the point at which the aerodrome would be released from the
car.</p>

<h3 title="Chapter V. Construction of Frame of Large Aerodrome.">CHAPTER V<br />
CONSTRUCTION OF FRAME OF LARGE AERODROME
</h3></div>

<p>The general plan for the large aerodrome was never a matter of uncertainty.
At the time when the first general designs were made there had been in
the history of mankind only one type of machine, that of the steam-driven Langley
models, which had proved capable of flight for any considerable distance.
Furthermore, the selection of this type had been the result not of sudden fancy
or of purely theoretical consideration, but of years of the most careful experimentation,
in the course of which nearly every conceivable style of machine had
been tested with some form of power. It would have been worse than folly,
therefore, if the one clear path had been left to seek some unknown way.</p>

<p>It was fully realized from the first, however, that the increase in size alone
would make necessary in the design for the large aerodrome a great many modifications
from the designs of the steam-driven models. It was not possible here,
as in nearly every other kind of structure, simply to magnify uniformly the
parts and proportions of the small machine in order to obtain a successful large
one. This is particularly true in the case of the aerodrome, because the rapid
increase of weight in the larger structure is out of all proportion to the increase
in strength, while it is very desirable that the more expensive machine which is
designed to carry a human being shall be relatively even stronger than the
easily replaced model. This problem of increasing size without sacrificing
strength and stability, it was known from the beginning, would be encountered
in a particularly difficult form in designing the frame of the large machine, and
was to be solved not by the discovery of some new and wonderfully strong material,
but by improvements both in the general plan and the details of the machine.
Here, as is often the case, it was not the large changes in the design but
the improvements in small and sometimes seemingly unimportant details which
demanded the most careful consideration and, as a whole, contributed most to
the final result. For this reason, as well as because the large changes, when
pointed out, are usually easily understood, the present chapter is for the most
part a description of the improvement of details.</p>

<p>From the experience gained in the construction of the frames of the several
steam-driven models, it was decided that the frame for the large aerodrome
must consist essentially of two principal parts. First, a rigid backbone was required,
extending from the point of attachment of the front wings to the point
of attachment of the rear wings; and this backbone, for convenience designated <span class="xxpn" id="p165">[p165]</span>
the “main frame,” must support the second principal part, the “transverse
frame,” which formed a cross with the main frame, and at the ends of which
the propellers were mounted. While it was necessary that this transverse
frame should have considerable rigidity and strength in a vertical direction,
yet its main strength and stiffness was required in the horizontal plane for
withstanding the thrust of the propellers. It had been possible to construct
the frames of the later steam-driven models stiff enough, and at the same
time light enough, by the use of properly proportioned steel tubing, but calculation
very soon showed that in order to secure sufficient rigidity for the frame of
the large aerodrome and at the same time keep the weight within the permissible
limit, it would be necessary to depend very largely on guy-wires and to
use tubing only for forming the struts against which the guy-wires should act.
But this obviously introduced a new series of problems. The extensive system
of guy-wires necessary would add materially to the head resistance of the aerodrome,
and this might conceivably be so great as to require more propulsive
power than would be required for a frame heavier but unincumbered by the
head resistance of the wires. It became necessary to consider these problems,
but no data were accessible from which the head resistance could be computed
with any confidence. The coefficient of resistance for a cylindrical body moving
through the air in a direction perpendicular to its length may in general be taken
as one-half that of a flat body of the same cross-section; but it was thought
very certain that, owing to the fact that tightly stretched wires are in constant
vibration when the aerodrome is in the air, the resistance of the wires must
be considerably greater than would be calculated from treating them as cylinders
having a coefficient of 0.5. Unfortunately, no data on the resistance of vibrating
wires were at hand. Before proceeding with the designs for the guying
of the frame, therefore, the following brief series of tests was made in
November, 1898, on the whirling table, in order to learn approximately the resistance
that the proposed system of guy-wires for the large aerodrome would
offer:</p>

<p>The last column of these tables is calculated for a coefficient of form equal
to 0.5, which has been found to be approximately correct for a rigid cylindrical
body.</p>

<p>These tables are not sufficiently extensive to determine accurately the exact
resistance that wires of various sizes will offer at given velocities, or to
serve as the basis for the deduction of formulæ, and were not made for that
purpose. However, from the above data, and the curves plotted in Plate <a href="#plt044">44</a>,
it will be seen that some unexpected results were obtained.</p>

RESISTANCE OF WIRES AT GIVEN VELOCITIES
<a class="linka" href="#listplates">◊</a></div>
</div>

<div class="xxpn" id="p167">[p167]</div>

<p>These results are fairly well summarized in the following general statements:
First, that the coefficient of resistance increases to some degree as the
size of the wire is decreased; second, that in the case of wires of the size which
it was expected to use, and at approximately the soaring speed of the aerodrome,
the resistance is certainly not greater than 75 per cent, and more probably
less than 50 per cent of the resistance encountered by a flat surface of the
same projected area; third, that the coefficient of resistance did not seem to be
increased by the vibration of the wires. On the contrary, it was noted during
the experiments that when they reached a speed which just caused them to
“sing,” there was a marked diminution in the resistance. This statement is
made, however, with some reserve, for it is probable that the singing of the
wires was due to vibration in the horizontal plane, and it is not definitely known
what the effect would be of vibration in the vertical plane.</p>

<p>To make the very extensive experiments necessary to determine these propositions
conclusively would have required much more time than could at this
period be spared from the actual constructional work on the aerodrome. Nevertheless,
the data did seem to indicate that it was at least not unwise to employ
the extensive system of guying which had been planned in order to give the necessary
strength to the frame of the large aerodrome. This plan of construction
was, therefore, definitely adopted, and as a result of later experience the system
of guying was still further extended.</p>

<p>As the transverse frame had to be made comparatively rigid in order to
prevent undue binding of the bearings of the transmission and propeller shafts,
it was necessary to make it intrinsically stronger and, therefore, heavier in
proportion to its size than the main frame. The main frame, although requiring
great strength to enable it to withstand the strains, both torsional and direct,
which were imposed upon it by the weights which it supported, did not
need excessive rigidity, and could, indeed, be distorted an appreciable amount
without danger of any serious effect on the action of the wings or rudder; but
even a small amount of distortion in the transverse frame might easily cause
such friction at the bearings of the shafts as to absorb fifty per cent or more of
the engine power.</p>

<p>In the photographs, Plates <a href="#plt045">45</a> to
<a href="#plt048">48</a>, which show the actual condition of the
frame on January 31 and February 1, 1900, the letters

which connect the midrods to the port
and starboard tubes. <em class="italic">R</em> is the front main tube of the transverse frame, the rear
main tube being exactly similar, and both being connected to the main tubes
of the main frame where they cross them. The ends of the main tubes of the <span class="xxpn" id="p168">[p168]</span>
transverse frame are joined together by the “bed plates” <em class="italic">L</em>, which are of I-beam
section, and have mounted on their outer faces the bearings which support
the propeller shafts. At <em class="italic">V</em> are bevel gears mounted on the propeller shafts,
which are driven by co-acting bevel gears, <em class="italic">M</em>, mounted on the outer ends of the
transmission shafts, <em class="italic">O</em>, the latter being at this point firmly supported in bearings
mounted on the inner faces of the bed plates and steadied by the intermediate
bearings, <em class="italic">N</em>. The two transmission shafts are seen to be not in line, the rotary
cylinder engine that was then under construction requiring this arrangement.
The bed plates, <em class="italic">L</em>, are further stiffened by the brace tubes, <em class="italic">K</em>, and the
transverse frame is braced against the thrust of the propellers by the tubes <em class="italic">J</em>.
The four tubes, <em class="italic">P</em>, unite at their upper ends to form what was designated as
the upper “pyramid,” and the wires, <em class="italic">S</em> and <em class="italic">T</em>, radiate from its apex to the
rear and front, respectively, of the main frame. The lower “pyramid,” on the
under side of the frame, also has similar wires running fore and aft. The
main portions of both frames are further strengthened by their sub-frames,
which merge together, and the main tubes of the main frame are individually
stiffened in the vertical plane by a minor system of guying. The scales shown
in the photographs are calibrated in metres.</p>

<p>It is to be particularly noted that the midrod, which had heretofore formed
the backbone of the main frame, was now made to act merely as a means of attaching
the wings to the frame, the main strength of the frame being furnished
by the two parallel fifty millimetre tubes which extended the entire length of
the frame and which, reinforced by the guy-wires, formed a truss not only more
rigid transversely, but also many times stronger in its ability to resist torsional
strains than could be secured by a single tube of equal weight. In this plan of
constructing the main frame, the pyramids constituted a very important element,
for with the guy-wires arranged as they were it was impossible for any
portion of the frame to experience a stress which was not transmitted in some
way to the pyramids. In the frame, as here shown, these pyramids were
formed of tubes 15 mm. in diameter, 0.5 mm. thick, stiffened against buckling
under the end pressure by means of the cross-braces, which united them near
their midpoints. While the sole function of the upper pyramid was to serve
in the system of guying the frame, the lower pyramid not only served a similar
purpose, but also provided a means for holding the aerodrome to the launching
car in the process of launching it, the clutch-hooks gripping around the
short horizontal tube at the apex of the pyramid and thus drawing the “bearing
points” of the machine firmly against the uprights on the car. In fact, the
particular arrangement of these pyramids was largely determined by this necessity
for providing means for holding the aerodrome to the launching car, and
the form which seemed best suited to the purpose was duplicated on the upper
side of the frame.</p>

<p>The “bearing points” were not attached to the frame at the time these
photographs were taken, but are seen leaning against the scales in the foreground
of Plate <a href="#plt046">46</a>. Their position on the frame will be more clearly seen in
later photographs, where it will be noted that they were made use of in the
more elaborate system of guying which was adopted.</p>

<p>While, in general, the frame at this time seemed to be reasonably stiff and
strong, yet it was subjected to a very thorough test by supporting it at different
points and suspending from it weights to represent the various parts, such
as engine, aviator, wings, rudder and so forth, the deflections which were produced
by these weights being carefully noted. It was further tested by subjecting
it to vibratory strains, such as it would be likely to meet in actual use. After
this the whole frame was tested against torsional strains, such as would be
caused by the wind twisting one set of wings more than the other. As a result
of these tests it was decided that the frame should be strengthened as far as it
was possible to do so without greatly increasing the weight, which even now
was found to be rapidly increasing beyond what had been calculated as permissible.
The main guy-wires were replaced by heavier and stronger ones, and
while these were found to add somewhat to the stiffness of the frame, yet something
more seemed necessary to insure safety.</p>

<p>The delay in securing the engine, which had been contracted for with a
guarantee that it would be delivered in February, 1899, had become so serious
and had delayed the completion of the frame to such an extent that the question
of building an exact duplicate of the large machine, but of one-quarter its
linear dimensions was being carefully considered at this time, and it was decided
to make no further changes in the guying of the large frame until after the
small one was built. On account of its smaller size changes could be more
readily and cheaply made on it, and the advantages of different methods of
guying could be just as well studied. Later, when this was completed, it was
found that, with the same system of guying that had been used in the larger
frame, the model was so very stiff that it did not require any further strengthening,
the smaller scale, of course, accounting for the difference. What was
thought to be the best system to follow in strengthening the frame of the large
machine was, however, first tried on the smaller one, and it was found that for
a very slight increase in weight a very great increase in strength could be obtained.
This change in the system of guying consisted essentially of building a
“trestle” of tubing at a point on the upper side, midway between the pyramid
and the rear end of the frame. One of the former sets of guy-wires which
passed to the rear of the frame was then replaced by a set which started at the
foot of the rear tubes of the upper pyramid, passed over and was fastened to
the trestle, and from there passed to the rear end of the frame at the points
where the longer guy-wires from the pyramid had formerly been attached.
The <span class="xxpn" id="p170">[p170]</span>
guy-wires on the lower side of the frame, at the rear, were correspondingly
changed so that the upper and lower systems should be similar, the wires which
started from the main tubes at the foot of the pyramid passing to the bearing
points, and from there to the rear end of the frame.</p>

<p>In order to keep the main frame of the large aerodrome as short as possible,
it had originally been planned to make the distance between the center of
pressure of the front wings and the center of pressure of the rear equal to five
metres. When these same proportions were followed in the quarter-size model,
it was found that it brought the rear wings so close to the propellers that their
lifting effect was certain to be interfered with by the blast of air created by the
slip of the propellers. It was therefore decided that all things considered it
would be best to increase this distance between the wings, even though this involved
an increase in weight, partly on account of the increased amount of
tubing, and still more on account of the guy-wires which it would be necessary
to add in order to make up for the weakness due to increased length. The large
aerodrome frame was accordingly lengthened 2.5 feet (76.2 cm.), and the guy-wire
system was changed to that clearly shown by the photographs of July 10,
1902, Plates <a href="#plt049">49</a>, <a href="#plt050">50</a> and
<a href="#plt051">51</a>, the black cross-lines on the background being 50
centimetres apart. From an inspection of these photographs it will be seen that
two sets of guy-wires were carried from the upper and lower pyramids, respectively,
towards the rear of the frame, the first set being carried to the main
tubes at the foot of the “trestle” and the bearing points, and the second set to
these same main tubes at the second cross-tube. The sets of wires which started
from the feet of the pyramids were carried over the “trestle” on the upper
side and the bearing points on the lower side, and both joined to the main tubes
at the rear cross-tube. Additional cross-guy-wires for stiffening the frame sideways
were added in each of the squares formed by the junction of the cross-tubes
with the main tubes. A secondary system of truss guy-wires running
over short guy-posts attached to the tubes of the main frame also contributed
to the strength and rigidity of the whole.</p>

<p>Although the pyramids had shown no signs of weakness, nevertheless, because
of increased strains due to the lengthening of the main frame, it was thought
advisable to make them stronger. Instead of the 15-mm. tubing, which had formerly
been used, 25-mm. tubing of the same thickness was therefore substituted,
and additional cross-braces were added, as will be seen from the photographs,
and from the scale drawings in Plates <a href="#plt052">52</a>, <a href="#plt053">53</a>
and <a href="#plt054">54</a>, which show the
aerodrome as it was when completed. The numerals attached to these drawings
refer to the detail drawings shown in later plates.</p>

<p>In order to secure the proper adjustment of the guy-wires, not only of the
frame but of many other parts, notably the wings, propellers and rudder, it
was necessary to use a large number of turn-buckles. As almost every wire <span class="xxpn" id="p171">[p171]</span>
required at least one, and in some cases two turn-buckles, the weight represented
by this single item rapidly became so formidable as to require serious
attention. In the construction of the models, it had been necessary to employ
some special turn-buckles in connecting the guy-wires of the wings to their guy-posts
in order to secure the minute adjustment of the wires necessary to prevent
the wings from being warped and distorted by unequal and improper adjustment.
These turn-buckles had been made in the Institution shops, as the
very lightest ones which could be secured in the market were from ten to twenty
times as heavy as it was necessary for them to be to provide ample strength.
In the construction of the large aerodrome, however, the large number required,
and the desire to complete the machine at the earliest moment, made it advisable
to procure the turn-buckles, if possible, from outside sources, and a very
careful search was accordingly made among the various dealers. After much
delay some bronze turn-buckles were secured which were very much stronger
for their weight than any others on the market, but upon testing them it was
found that while they weighed 45 grammes, their average breaking strength was
only 593 pounds. Previous experience had shown that turn-buckles which would
not break under a less load than 750 pounds could certainly be made to weigh
not more than 18 grammes. As even at this time it was realized that at least
100 turn-buckles would be necessary for the entire machine, the excess weight
which the heavy turn-buckles would add was felt to be absolutely prohibitory,
and the construction of steel turn-buckles was immediately begun in the Institution
shops. These turn-buckles were at first made in several sizes, and while
some few were at first made “double ended,” most of them were threaded at
only one end, the other end being provided with a swivel-hook, or eye. They
were at first made of mild steel, the swivel-hooks, in fact, being made of wire
nails in order to utilize the head of the nail as a shoulder without the expense
of machining rod steel of a size large enough to form the shoulder. It was
found, however, that the weak point of this type of turn-buckle was the swivel
end, and most of those which were then on hand were made double ended by
removing the hook, tapping a left-hand thread into this end of the shank, and
fitting a threaded eye-socket in it. The guy-wires themselves were attached to
the eyes of the turn-buckles and to the fittings on the frame by twisting loops
at the ends of the wires, and although the very greatest difference in the strength
of a completed guy-wire may result from the way in which the loops are twisted,
yet, after much training, the workmen were taught to twist these very uniformly,
following the plan which can be best understood by an inspection of the drawings
in Plate <a href="#plt055">55</a> which show the loops more clearly than they can be described.
After the loops had been properly twisted, soft solder was run all through the
twist in order to unite firmly the twists of the wire. Although special grades
of wire were found which showed very high tensile strength when the wire was <span class="xxpn" id="p172">[p172]</span>
tested without having loops formed in its ends, yet it appeared that the twisting
of these high-grade wires so seriously affected them that in the case of guy-wires
with loops at the ends, better final results could be obtained by using
softer grades of steel. The wire which was actually found best, after much experiment,
was a good grade of Bessemer steel of a medium hardness, which had
been “coppered” to prevent rusting. However, even with the softer grades of
steel wire, it was found that there were sometimes hard spots in the wire which
revealed themselves only upon test, and that when a hard spot occurred in the
twisted portion where the loop was formed, the final strength of the completed
guy-wire was sometimes only twenty-five per cent of what it should be. The
precaution was then taken to subject each of the completed guys to a test strain
at least twenty-five per cent greater than it was calculated the wire would have
to stand in actual use, so that no accident from defective wires would be likely
to occur.</p>

<p>Later on, however, much trouble was caused by the loops in the ends of
some of the guy-wires slipping, owing to the giving way of the solder which
had been run through the joint, the amount of slipping, while small, being sufficient
to alter completely the relative stresses on the various wires, thus causing
distortion of the framework itself. In order to avoid this difficulty a new
method was devised of attaching the guy-wires to the turn-buckles and to the
fittings by which they were carried to the frame. This method consisted in
threading the ends of the guy-wires so that they could be inserted directly
in the threaded ends of the turn-buckles. The wires when connected in this way
to the turn-buckles showed absolutely no slip, and the entire system gained
greatly in strength thereby. The only disadvantage which was found in this
new method of attaching the guy-wires to their fittings, was that if the wire was
bent very close to the fitting, it would break in the screw thread very easily.
But since most of the guy-wires when once attached to the machine are always
tight, and in fact, under more or less strain, there was in most cases no likelihood
of the wires being endangered by being bent close to the fittings. Since
the screw threads, which it was necessary to adopt in this new plan of connecting
the guy-wires, had to be very much finer than the threads which had been
used in the turn-buckles previously constructed, it was necessary to make new
turn-buckles, the others being too thin to permit of their being bored out, bushed
and re-threaded. The new turn-buckles were made of a much higher grade of
steel, and probably represent very nearly the maximum of strength for the minimum
of weight possible without the use of some of the very much higher-grade
steels which have recently come on the market, but which are exceedingly expensive
to work. By means of this improved plan of attaching the wires,<a id="fnanchor_42" href="#footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> it <span class="xxpn" id="p173">[p173]</span>
was found possible to gain practically fifty per cent in the strength of the entire
system of guy-wires used on the frame.</p>

<p>Many small changes were from time to time made in the various small fittings
by which the guy-wires were attached to the frame, nearly all of these fittings
having been originally made of a very mild grade of steel owing to the fact
that it was so very much easier to work. At the time these fittings were made
it was constantly expected that a trial of the aerodrome would be possible very
soon, and it seemed necessary to expedite the work as much as possible and
avoid the delay involved in using grades of steel that would have been materially
harder to work. As is always the case in work of this kind, retrospect
shows many instances where what was supposed to be a short cut to results
actually proved to be the longest path, but the work as a whole was remarkably
free from imperfect parts which necessitated reconstruction.</p>

<p>In the construction of the frames of the models it had been customary to
fit the tubing accurately at the joints and to join it permanently together by
brazing, as this was not only the lightest form of joint that could be made,
but also the most expeditious method consistent with securing a strength of the
joint comparable with that of the tubing itself. The construction of the frame
by this method of brazing the joints together permanently, offered, however,
several serious drawbacks: among them, that when a tube got injured it was a
considerable task to replace it, while the brazing of the new tube in place required
extreme care to prevent the frame from being warped when completed,
as the tube became longer while very hot and contracted after the joint had
set. Furthermore, the great heat required destroyed to a considerable degree
the desirable qualities due to the tube being “cold drawn,” a reduction of
strength of something like 25 per cent being almost inevitable, even when the
brazing was most carefully done. It was, therefore, decided that in the construction
of the large machine all of the main joints should be made by a system
of “thimbles,” and it was planned at first to make these thimbles by
brazing short pieces of steel tubing into the proper shapes and angles so that
they would accurately fit the tubes which were to be joined. The construction
of the thimbles in this manner, however, seemed to involve an excessive amount
of work; and, as it was found that very thin castings of aluminum-bronze
could be obtained, which would show a tensile strength very nearly as great
as steel, it was decided to make up patterns for the thimbles and cast them of
aluminum-bronze.</p>

<p>The aluminum-bronze castings were obtained and properly machined to fit
the tubes, but when it was attempted to “tin” the interior walls of the thimbles
it was found that the solder could not be made to stick to the bronze.
As a considerable amount of work had been expended on the machine work of
these thimbles much time and effort was spent in
attempting to devise “fluxes” <span class="xxpn" id="p174">[p174]</span>
and solders which could be made to work with the aluminum-bronze, but the
final result was that the aluminum-bronze thimbles had to be abandoned. They
were replaced by similar castings of gun-metal of a slightly heavier section,
which at the time were thought to be very suitable for the purpose.</p>

<p>But, in finally assembling the frame after the changes described above had
been made, steel thimbles, built up of short pieces of tubing, as had originally
been planned, were substituted for the gun-metal thimbles. This change was
made not only because of the great increase in strength, but more particularly
because many of the gun-metal fittings had been imperfectly constructed, so
that it was extremely difficult to align the frame. The steel thimbles, which
were made in the Institution shops proved thoroughly satisfactory and gave no
trouble of any kind. Many of these thimbles and the method of attaching the
guy-wire fittings to them are shown in Plates <a href="#plt056">56</a> and
<a href="#plt057">57</a>, as well as in Plate <a href="#plt055">55</a>.</p>

</h4>

<p>It will be recalled from the description of the models Nos. 5 and 6, in Part
I, that the position of the line of thrust, with respect to the positions of the
center of pressure and center of gravity in the vertical plane was, theoretically,
very much better in No. 6 than in No. 5. In designing the large aerodrome,
it was desired to reproduce as nearly as possible the relative position of the line
of thrust with reference to the center of pressure and center of gravity which existed
in No. 6, but for constructional reasons it was found impossible to do so. In
fact it appeared that without seriously complicating the construction of the frame
it was impossible to raise the line of thrust with respect to the center of gravity
materially higher than it was in No. 5. In No. 6 the line of thrust was 12 centimetres
above the midrod, this being effected by placing the engines some distance
from the boiler, and at the extreme ends of the transverse frame where
they were connected directly to the propellers. In the case of the steam engine
the weight of the engine proper is a relatively small portion of the entire
weight of the power plant, and it is, therefore, possible to put the engine almost
anywhere without materially affecting the center of gravity. But where
a gas engine is used the engine itself constitutes the greater part of the weight
of the power plant, and any raising of the engine, therefore, materially raises
the center of gravity of the whole machine. The line of thrust in the large
aerodrome was, therefore, practically in the plane of the main frame, and consequently
very little higher than the center of gravity.</p>

<p>The use of one engine to drive two propellers mounted at opposite ends
of the transverse frame, and in a direction perpendicular to the crank shaft of
the engine, necessitates the use of a pair of bevel gears between each of the
propeller shafts and the shafts by which the power
is conveyed to them from <span class="xxpn" id="p175">[p175]</span>
the engine shaft. Since the efficient transmission of power through bevel gears
requires that they be very accurately placed with reference to each other, and
maintained very accurately in this position while they are at work, it was necessary
to make the transverse frame very rigid, especially at its extreme ends.
This was accomplished by the use of what were called “propeller-shaft bed
plates.” They are designated by the numeral 27 in Plate <a href="#plt054">54</a>, and are shown
in detail in Plate <a href="#plt058">58</a> as of a very deep I-beam section, having very narrow
flanges top and bottom, the web of the I-beam furnishing the strength in a
vertical direction, while sufficient stiffness laterally was obtained from the flanges,
assisted by the brace tubes, which acted as struts between the bed plates and
the main tubes of the transverse frame. These struts, while very light, added
enormously not only to the lateral stiffness of the propeller bed plates, but
furnished for a minimum weight a maximum prevention against twisting of the
plates. The propeller-shaft bed plates were originally planned to be made
of sheet metal with the flanges brazed to the web. But at the time that they
were constructed the pressure of the work was so great in the Institution shops
that it was found necessary to have some of the work done outside, and the
parties who undertook the construction of these bed plates were unwilling to
attempt to braze them up, and accordingly worked them from steel forgings
made for the purpose. The expense of this plan of construction proved large
and unnecessary, as both previous and later experience proved that it was not
only practicable to braze up bed plates more complicated in their design than
these, but that equal strength for equal weight could thus be obtained for less
than one-quarter the cost of constructing them from solid forgings. Furthermore,
where such parts are made from the solid, changes which later tests
prove advisable can frequently not be carried out without very serious cost
and delay, while with the bed plates formed by brazing less hesitancy is felt in
removing parts which are brazed thereto and substituting new parts, or even
discarding the bed plates altogether and substituting new ones. Particular emphasis
is laid on this point for the reason that much expense and delay would
have been avoided had these very expensive propeller-shaft bed plates been discarded
as early as 1901 and replaced by others which would have permitted a
considerable strengthening of the ball-bearings, which, while strong enough to
stand even more power than they were originally designed for, were far too
weak to be safe when working under the greatly increased stress due to the
very much higher engine power which was later used. Instead of discarding
these bed plates then for new ones, they were strengthened by brazing to them
crescent-shaped pieces, as shown in the drawings and photographs. This
strengthening was made necessary by the larger hole cut in the bed plates for
the larger bevel gears. The bed plates for the engine, which are later described,
besides other bed plates which were made for other purposes, were all <span class="xxpn" id="p176">[p176]</span>
formed by the use of sheet metal and tubing properly brazed together, and
none of them ever gave any trouble.</p>

<p>In the early photographs of the aerodrome frame, especially that of January
31, 1900, Plate <a href="#plt045">45</a>, it will be noted that the two transmission shafts, which
extend from the propeller-shaft bed plates towards the center, are not in line,
the port transmission shaft being at the center of the transverse frame, while
the starboard shaft is three inches to one side. This arrangement was necessary
in order to connect the shafts to the rotary cylinder engine which was
being constructed under contract, and which was almost momentarily expected
for more than a year after its original promise of delivery on February 28,
1899. Later, when this engine was finally found to be a failure, and the writer
constructed the engine in the Institution shops, the starboard transmission shaft
was moved over to the center line and the crank shaft of the engine, which was
carried through on the center line of the transverse frame, was then connected
directly to the inner ends of the transmission shafts.</p>

<p>These shafts, as well as the propeller shafts, were originally constructed
of steel tubing 1.5 inches in diameter and
<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">16</span></span>
of an inch thick, but on account
of the increased power of the large engine it was found necessary to increase
the thickness of the shafts to
<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">8</span></span>
of an inch. Difficulty was also found with the
tubing of which the shafts were made. This, though not exactly straight when
received from the factory, could be pretty accurately straightened in the lathe
by exercising proper care, but the moment any real strain was put upon it in
the transmission of power, it again went out of shape and caused serious damage
to the bearings by whirling, buckling, and so forth. As the skin of the tubing
is really the strongest part, owing to the cold-drawing process to which it
has been subjected, great care was taken to secure shafts which were sufficiently
straight for use without machining, but it was finally found impossible
to rely on the unmachined shafts, and all the later shafts for the aerodrome
were made by getting tubing a sixty-fourth of an inch thicker than was calculated
to be necessary and turning off this extra metal in a lathe.</p>

</div>

<p>Suitable flanges and collars were brazed to the propeller shafts; but, for
convenience in assembling, the flanges by which the main transmission shafts
were connected to the crank shaft of the engine were at first fastened to the
shafts by screw-threads, the threads being in the proper direction to cause the
flanges to jam against the shoulders of the shafts when the engine turned in
its normal direction. This method of fastening, however, caused serious trouble,
owing to the flanges jamming so tight that it became impossible to unscrew
them after they had once been used in driving the propellers. The usual provisions
of keys and key-ways adopted in general engineering practice, where
solid shafts are employed, were, of course, out of the question, since the shaft
would have to be greatly increased in thickness throughout its entire length <span class="xxpn" id="p177">[p177]</span>
merely to provide the extra metal at the small place in which the key-ways
were formed. Taper pins either sheared off or very soon stretched the holes
so badly as to leave the parts loose, and were otherwise very unsatisfactory.
The method finally adopted, which proved very successful, was that of forming
integral with the couplings shallow internal tongues and grooves which fitted
corresponding tongues and grooves either in the exterior surface of the shafts
or in collars brazed to them at the proper point. The form of flange coupling,
in which bolts draw the two flanges tightly together, was also a source of considerable
trouble and delay, which was finally overcome by forming shallow
tongues and grooves in the faces of the flanges, the tongues taking up the torsion
and relieving the bolts which held the flanges together of all strain except
one of slight tension. The same difficulties experienced in mounting the
couplings on the shafts were met with in connection with the gears, both on
the propeller and transmission shafts, and were finally obviated in a manner
similar to that described above.</p>

<p>The bevel gears originally constructed for transmitting the power from
the transmission shafts to the propeller shafts, were made of case-hardened
steel and were eight-pitch, twenty-five teeth, with three-quarter inch width of
face. The gears were very accurately planed to give as perfect a form of
tooth as possible, in order to avoid loss of power in transmission, and although
the manufacturer who cut the teeth on them asserted at the time they were
made that they would not be capable of transmitting more than five horse-power,
yet they actually did transmit considerably more than twelve horse-power
on each set; but they were not strong enough to transmit the full power
of the large engine which was finally used. The gears that were finally used
were similarly constructed of mild steel which was case hardened
<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">64</span></span>
of an
inch deep after they were finished, there being thirty-one teeth in the gear on
the transmission shaft and forty teeth in the one on the propeller shaft, the
teeth being eight-pitch, three-quarters of an inch face. These light gears proved
amply strong, and several times stood the strain which they accidentally received
when one of the propellers broke while the engine was under full power,
and thus threw the entire fifty horse-power over on the other propeller, which
was consequently driven at a greatly increased speed.</p>

<p>Plain bronze bearings had been used throughout on the model aerodromes,
but in the construction of the large aerodrome ball-bearings were used on all
of the propeller and transmission shafts, not only on account of the decreased
loss through friction, but also because ball-bearings can be built much lighter
than solid bronze ones, and, furthermore, do not present such great difficulties
in lubrication. However, owing to the limited size which it was possible to secure
for these bearings, because of their having been originally designed for only
twenty-four horse-power, and without any margin for a later increase of the <span class="xxpn" id="p178">[p178]</span>
space in which they had to be applied, they were never really large enough
for the work they had to do when transmitting the full power of the large engine.
They gave continual trouble, and were the source of delay which, while
it cannot be accurately measured, since there were often other causes, yet might
be conservatively estimated at not less than three or four months. Such a delay,
when reckoned in retrospect, can easily be seen to have caused an expense
which would have sufficed for almost any change in the bearings, bed plates,
etc., had the change been made immediately after the bearings were found to
give trouble. With the better steel which it is now possible to obtain for the
races of the bearings, and with the high-grade balls now obtainable, the bearings
could be readily replaced without changing any other parts and still be
amply strong for the work.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">P<span class="smmaj">ROPELLERS</span></span></h4>

<p>Both the tests on the whirling-table and the actual results with the models
had shown that propellers which were true helices formed out of wood were
rather more efficient than those constructed by the use of a hub in which were
inserted wooden arms, forming a framing over which cloth was tightly drawn.
But the very great difference in the cost of construction and the facility with
which the latter type could be repaired in case of damage—the wooden ones
were practically of no use if once they were much injured-—made it seem advisable
to construct all the propellers for the large aerodrome in the manner
just explained. Several pair of small propellers had been built on this plan,
some as early as 1895, and one very important advantage had been found to
be possessed by this type besides cheapness and facility of repair. Wooden
propellers of even so small a diameter as one metre had been found to suffer
a quite appreciable bending of the blades, due to the thrust produced by them,
even though the blades had been made of considerable thickness. In planning
a propeller 2.5 metres in diameter for the large aerodrome it was seen that in
order to make the blade sufficiently strong to withstand its own thrust it would
be necessary to make it inordinately thick, which, of course, would mean a considerable
increase in weight. In fact, it was seen that the weight of the larger
propellers would increase practically as the cube of the diameter; which, for
the 2.5-metre propeller, would involve a weight of something over fifteen times
the weight of those one metre in diameter. The other type, which for convenience
we will call “canvas covered,” permitted the bending moment produced
on the blade by the thrust to be taken up by guy-wires running from the corners
of the blades to a central post projecting from the hub of the propeller,
and it was found that in this way a considerable saving in weight could be
effected.
<span class="xxpn" id="p179">[p179]</span></p>

<p>In November, 1897, in order to obtain by actual test some data on propellers,
such as it was planned to use on the large aerodrome in case it was
later built, it was decided to construct one propeller 2.5 metres in diameter and
1.25-pitch ratio with two blades, each covering the sector of 36 degrees on the
projected circle. About this same time an engine builder, who some years before
had made some experimental model engines in the Institution shops, proposed
to construct a gasoline engine for the proposed large aerodrome. As
past experience, not only with such engines but with all other forms of explosive
motors, had not been very reassuring it was thought best to make brake
tests of one of the heavier engines which he was at this time building, and at
the same time make tests with one of these large propellers. A first series of
tests was made at several different speeds, and then a second series was made
with the engine driving the propeller at the same speeds. The engine varied
so much, however, in the power developed at any speed that the data obtained
were of little value. As it was also desired to learn just how much thrust
could be obtained from these propellers, when driven by a given horse-power, a
special hand car was fitted up to carry the engine, which was connected to a
shaft on which the propeller was mounted. The propeller was raised above
the floor of the car and projected over the rear end of it so as to be as little
disturbed as possible by the deflection of the air currents caused by the car.
This car, with the engine and propeller, was tested on a track near Mount Holly,
N. J., in November, 1897, but the results were very unsatisfactory. In the first
place, the car with the engine mounted on it was so very heavy and offered
such a strong tractive resistance that very little speed of propulsion could be
obtained. In the second place, the engine, which was said to have furnished
over six horse-power on Prony-brake tests, evidently did not furnish anything
like this amount of power at this time. And in the third place, the propeller
was evidently far too large to permit the engine to run at the speed at which
it would develop a reasonable amount of power unless some reduction gearing
were interposed between it and the propeller. As the tests, for various reasons,
had to be made at a great distance from Washington, and the supervision of
them had to be entrusted by Mr. Langley to others, who either did not understand
or appreciate the value of obtaining accurate data, it was found impracticable
to continue them.</p>

<p>The large propeller used in these tests was built without special regard to
weight, since it was expected that it would be subjected to rather rough usage
under the very sudden strains produced by the irregular working of the gas
engine. Its hub was made of brass tubing, the horns being brazed to rings
which were slid over a central tube, the rings being finally soldered to the tube
after the arms had been adjusted to the positions which would give the blade
the correct shape and dimensions. The wooden arms were 1.5 inches in <span class="xxpn" id="p180">[p180]</span>
diameter at the hub end, tapering to 1.25 inches at the end of the blade. The blade
was exceedingly stiff as regards pressure produced by thrust, but it was found
to be considerably strengthened and made very much safer when guy-wires were
added, in the manner explained above. This general type of construction was
adhered to in all the future propellers for the aerodrome, though slight modifications,
both as to the size of the arms and the number and position of the
cross-pieces which formed the framing of the blade, were adopted from time to
time. A pair of heavy propellers, 2.5 metre, 1.25-pitch ratio, 36-degree blade,
the hubs of which were formed of brass castings, was, however, constructed
for experimental purposes, where weight was not an important factor.</p>

<p>When these propellers were designed, the calculations as to their size and
the horse-power which would be required to drive them at a certain speed were
based on the very incomplete data obtained from the various propeller tests
conducted during the preceding years. When later calculations were made for
them, on the data obtained in the more accurate tests made in the summer of
1898, it was found that the power of the engines with which it was proposed to
equip the aerodrome would not be sufficient to drive the propellers at anything
like the speed which the former calculations had shown would be possible; and
that, therefore, either the ratio of the gearing between the propellers and the
engine would have to be changed so as to permit the engine to run at a very
much higher speed than the propellers, or that propellers, having either less
pitch or a smaller diameter, and possibly both, would have to be substituted for
these larger ones.</p>

<p>Since it was easier to change the propellers then to change the gearing,
a new set of propellers was designed which were of 2 metres diameter, with a
pitch ratio of unity, and with a width of blade of only 30 degrees. It was calculated
that 20 horse-power would drive these two propellers at a speed of 640
R. P. M., when the aerodrome was flying at a speed of 35 feet per second and
the propellers were slipping about 50 per cent, this being found to be about the
speed at which the engines might be expected to develop their maximum power.
As the larger propellers having the brass hubs were thought to be excessively
heavy, the hubs weighing 10.25 pounds each, and as any change either in size,
pitch, or width of blade necessitated a new set of patterns in case the hubs
were cast, it was decided to construct the new hubs of steel tubing. The weight
was further reduced by decreasing the size of the wooden arms to
<span class="mixfract">1<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">4</span></span></span>
inch in
diameter at the hub, tapering to 1 inch at the end of the blade.</p>

<p>After the engine builder in New York had been unable to fulfil his contract
on the engine, and it had been condemned, propeller tests were made with the
experimental engine built in the Institution shops. These tests showed: First,
that the results which might be expected from larger propellers could be very
safely predicted by extrapolation from the results
of the propeller tests of 1898; <span class="xxpn" id="p181">[p181]</span>
and, second, that in order to get a thrust which would equal fifty per cent of
the flying weight of the aerodrome it would be necessary to use propellers larger
than two metres in diameter unless a very large surplus of power were provided.
It was accordingly decided to make a set of propellers intermediate between
the two-metre, unit-pitch ratio, thirty-degree blade ones, and the original
ones which were two and one-half metres, one and one-quarter-pitch ratio,
thirty-six-degree
blade. A set was, therefore, designed two and one-half metres in
diameter, unit-pitch ratio, and thirty-degree width of blade, the hubs being made
of steel tubing brazed up in the same manner as the two-metre ones, and the
wooden arms of the blades being one and three-eighths inches in diameter at the
hub end, and tapering to one inch at the end of the blade.</p>

<p>Later, when the larger engine was actually tested in the frame, the inability
of the original transmission and propeller shafts to stand the extra strain
caused by the engine starting up very suddenly at times, together
with the unsatisfactoriness
of the screw-thread method of fastening the gears and couplings
to the shafts made it necessary to provide new shafts, gears, couplings, etc. It
was then decided to change the ratio of gearing between the engine and the
propellers, which had been one to one, so that the engine might run faster and,
therefore, permit the use of larger propellers. For constructional reasons the
ratio chosen was thirty-one to forty, thus making the engine run approximately
one-third faster than the propellers.</p>

<p>In the various tests made of the engine working in the frame there were
two or three instances in which the propellers were damaged either by the sudden
starting of the engine or by their not being able to stand the strain to which
they were subjected by the power absorbed, but in every case such breakages
were found to be due to imperfections of the brazing in the joints. While,
therefore, it would have been desirable to make the propellers somewhat heavier,
yet since the total weight of the aerodrome had been growing so very rapidly,
it was felt that this need not be done, as a pair of propellers which had stood
quite severe service in shop tests might reasonably be expected to stand the
strain of actually propelling the aerodrome through the air.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, when in the summer of 1903 the actual trials of the large
aerodrome were started, it was found that the very important difference between
a propeller working in a closed room and one working in the open air
had not been given due consideration. Several sets of propellers, 2.5 metres in
diameter, unit-pitch ratio, 30-degree blade had been constructed and were on
hand, in order that no delays might be caused through a lack of such extra
parts. On September 9, 1903, when the aerodrome frame without the wings
was mounted on the launching car on top of the boat for some trial runs with
the engine to make sure that everything was again in readiness, before the engine
had made 500 revolutions, the port propeller broke; and a few minutes <span class="xxpn" id="p182">[p182]</span>
later, when a new propeller had been substituted for this and the engine was
again started up, the starboard propeller also broke. When, upon further trials
and replacements of propellers, all had been so thoroughly demolished that
there was not a complete set remaining, it was seen very clearly that the strains
produced on a propeller working in the open air are very much greater than
those produced in shop tests, where the air is necessarily quiet. These open-air
tests of the propellers had demonstrated that their weakest point was where
the steel tubes which received the wooden arms of the blade terminated, and that
another, though not so serious, point of weakness was where the steel arms
were brazed to the central hub, the thin metal tending to tear loose even before
the brazed joint would give way. It was, therefore, decided to construct immediately
a new set of propellers in which the steel arms should be made of
much heavier tubing, that is, a sixteenth of an inch thick at the end where it
was brazed to the central hub, and tapering in thickness to one-thirty-second
of an inch at the other end. These arms were further made twelve inches long
in place of being only three inches long as before. This added length carried
the steel out beyond the point where the first section brace joined the three
arms together, and where they were further strengthened by having the cloth
covering tightly stretched around them. In order to utilize such of the hubs of
the former propellers as had not been seriously damaged when the propellers
broke, it was also decided to try the effect of merely adding an extra length of
tube to the short arms by means of a thimble slipped over and brazed to the
two parts, which would make these arms twelve inches long. The construction
of these propellers was pushed as rapidly as possible; and after their completion
no further trouble was at any later time caused by insufficient strength
of the propellers. Even in the test of October 7, 1903, when the aerodrome
came down in the water at a speed of something like fifty miles an hour, and
at an angle of approximately forty-five degrees, no break occurred in either
propeller until, when the aerodrome was plunging through the water, a blade
of one propeller was broken by the terrific blow which it received when it struck
the water under the impulse of the engine driving it at full speed. The severity
of this blow is attested by the fact that the shaft,
which was of steel tubing one-eighth
inch thick, was twisted about ninety degrees.</p>

<p>This experience with propellers very strongly emphasizes the fact that on
any flying machine the strains which are apt to be met with in the open air must
be allowed for in the proportioning of the parts of the machine. But since an
indiscriminate increase of strength in all the various parts of the machine would
entail a prohibitory weight, very careful judgment, based on experience, will
have to be exercised in deciding just where added strength must be employed,
and also where the “live strains” are not apt to exceed very appreciably the
calculation for statical conditions.</p>

<div class="xxpn" id="p183">[p183]</div>

<p>Owing to Mr. Langley’s belief that the tests of the man-carrying aerodrome
must not only be made over the water, but that it was necessary that the
machine be launched from a car running on a track at a considerable elevation
in order to permit the machine to drop a short distance after being launched in
case it was not quite up to soaring speed when launched, it was necessary that
the aerodrome be so constructed that it could be readily transported to the
launching track from the interior of the house-boat where it was stored. This
plan of storing the main body of the machine in the interior of the boat and
hoisting it to the launching track just before attempting a flight (some of the
difficulties of which may be more clearly appreciated by an inspection of Plate
<a href="#plt060">60</a>), made it necessary that the wings, tail and guy-posts be so constructed as to
be readily attachable to and detachable from the main frame, and since the
weather conditions are seldom suitable for a test for more than a couple of hours
at a time, it was necessary that the mechanism employed for attaching these
parts be so arranged that the proper settings of the different parts could be
quickly obtained, and without requiring the exercise of judgment which past experience
had shown did not often manifest itself during the hurry of the preparations
for a test. While the wings, therefore, were made removable, yet all of
the sockets, guy-wires, etc., which were loosened in removing them, were made
with positive stops on them so that each fitting that was to be tightened up
in assembling could be adjusted to its definitely determined position.</p>

<p>As all of the models had been constructed with these same parts removable
in order to permit them to be readily shipped back and forth in the many trips
which had been made with them from Washington to Chopawamsic Island, the
same details of arrangement were used for attaching these parts on the large
aerodrome, though the actual fittings by which the parts were attached in the
latter case became more elaborate.</p>

<p>In the drawings, Plates <a href="#plt052">52</a>, <a href="#plt053">53</a>
and <a href="#plt054">54</a>, the method of attaching the wings
to the frame is clearly shown. Each of the two main ribs of each wing
was secured to the midrod of the frame by a wing clamp, shown in detail in
Figs. 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 of Plate <a href="#plt059">59</a>. Figs. 1 and 2 show the clamp for the middle
main rib of each pair of wings, and Figs. 5 and 6 show the clamp for the main
front rib, the latter being so constructed that the wings could be rocked on the
midrib clamp as a pivot and secured at any angle of lift desired from
<span class="mixfract">6<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">2</span></span></span>
degrees
to 15 degrees. The horns on each clamp merely acted as receiving sockets
for the ends of the ribs, and were not in any way intended to do anything
more than merely hold the ends of the ribs in their correct positions. The wings
were fastened to the frame by the guy-wires which ran from two points on each
main rib to an upper and a lower guy-post mounted on the midrod. The system
of guy-wires for the wings is clearly shown in Plates <a href="#plt052">52</a>,
<a href="#plt053">53</a> and <a href="#plt054">54</a>,
and <span class="xxpn" id="p184">[p184]</span>
in Plate <a href="#plt061">61</a>, which shows the aerodrome mounted on its launching car at the
rear end of the track, and with the front pair of wings in place and all the
guy-wires adjusted. The details of the guy-posts are shown in Plate <a href="#plt062">62</a>, where
it will be noted that the lower guy-post was of wood, with metal fittings, and
was 2 metres long from the center of the midrod to the bottom, while the
upper guy-post was a steel tube 109 centimetres long from the center of the
midrod to its top. The guy-wires from the middle rib of each of the pair of
wings were fastened to the fittings at the bottom of the lower guy-post, while
the wires from the front main rib were fastened to the fittings which were
brazed and riveted to the slidable collar, which was mounted on the steel tube
forming the cap on this guy-post. This collar was made slidable to permit the
angle of lift of the wings to be readily changed without affecting the length of
the guy-wires. This collar, when once set for any particular angle of the wing,
was prevented from sliding by a taper pin (not shown) which passed through
it and the guy-post. In order to secure the wings more rigidly to the main
frame and thereby throw on it all torsional strains from the wings, which it
was specially designed to take, each of the middle main ribs was secured to
one of the main tubes of the main frame by an auxiliary clamp at the point
where this rib crossed the main tube. These auxiliary clamps are clearly shown
in Figs. 3 and 4 of Plate <a href="#plt059">59</a>.</p>

<p>Projecting from the lower end of each of the lower guy-posts
was a five-sixteenth-inch
steel rod about one inch long, as clearly seen in Plate <a href="#plt062">62</a>. Brazed
to the side of this rod, in such a position that it would project towards the rear
of the aerodrome when the guy-post was in position, was a small arm or bracket.
When the guy-post was in place with the aerodrome on the launching car,
this pin was in a slot formed in a metal cap on the top of the small folding
upright at the front or rear of the car, as seen in Fig. 1, Plate <a href="#plt063">63</a>, while
Fig. 2 of Plate <a href="#plt063">63</a> shows the pin just being inserted into this slot as the
guy-wires of the guy-post are being fastened. This small arm or bracket on
this rod projected under the cap to prevent the rod of the guy-post from being
lifted out of the slot in the folding upright, when the wind acting under
the wings tended to lift the aerodrome from the car. Particular attention is here
called to this apparently insignificant detail, for it was this arm or bracket on
this small rod of the front guy-post which, hanging in the cap on top of the
folding upright, caused the accident in the launching of the aerodrome on October
7, 1903. Certain it is that but for the accident due to this apparently insignificant
detail, success would have crowned the efforts of Mr. Langley, who
above all men deserved success in this field of work, which his labors had so
greatly enriched.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">A<span class="smmaj">VIATOR’S</span></span>
<span class="smcap">C<span class="smmaj">AR</span></span></h4>

<p>In determining on a suitable car for the aviator various designs were made,
differing all the way from that in which the aviator occupied a sitting position
facing directly ahead and with practically no freedom of movement, but was
even strapped to the machine to avoid the possibility of being thrown out, to
the one finally adopted, in which he was provided with the greatest freedom of
movement, could either stand or sit, as the occasion seemed to demand, and
could face in any direction for giving proper attention to any of the multitudinous
things which might at any time require his attention, and could, if agile,
even climb from the extreme front of the machine to the rear. The wisdom
of giving the aviator complete freedom without hampering him in any way by
provisions for preventing his being thrown out of the machine was amply justified,
as will later be seen in the description of the tests of the machine, where
freedom of movement and agility prevented a fatal accident.</p>

<p>The aviator’s car was therefore designed to occupy the entire available
space between the engine and the front bearing points, and between the two
main tubes of the main frame, thus allowing him a space of something like
three feet by five feet. The car itself was shaped like a flat-bottomed boat,
the bottom being approximately level with the bottom of the lower pyramid.
It had a guard rail of steel tubing eighteen inches above the floor, with a cloth
covering drawn over the frame to decrease the head resistance of the appurtenances
of the engine which were placed at the rear end of the car. The car
was supported by vertical wires passing from its bottom up to the main frame,
and was prevented from longitudinal or side motion by being fastened at the
front to the cross-rod connecting the front bearing points, and at the rear to
the lower pyramid. A light wooden seat extended fore and aft of the car at
a height of about two feet from the floor, this seat resting on blocks of sponge
rubber to absorb some of the tremor which existed in the whole aerodrome
when the engine and propellers were working at high speed. The aviator was
thus free to stand, to sit sidewise or to straddle the seat, and while the network
of wires surrounding him prevented any great possibility of his being thrown
out, yet there was a comparatively large opening between the guy-wires passing
overhead which permitted him to climb out of the machine.</p>

<p>In order to enable the aviator to know exactly how the engine was operating,
a tachometer, giving instantaneous readings of the number of revolutions,
was connected by a suitable gear to one of the transmission shafts and placed
where it could readily be seen.</p>

<p>During 1898 and 1899 considerable time and attention had been given to
designing an instrument to be carried by the aerodrome which would automatically
record the number of revolutions of the engine, the velocity and direction <span class="xxpn" id="p186">[p186]</span>
of the wind relative to the machine, the height of the aerodrome as shown by
a specially sensitive aneroid barometer, and the angle of the machine with the
horizontal plane of the earth. The construction of this instrument was undertaken
by a noted firm of instrument makers, but after many months of delay,
during which it was several times delivered as being complete, only to be returned
for further work, it was finally condemned as unsatisfactory, and it was
decided not to encumber the machine with such a delicate apparatus, which,
even if perfectly made, could not be depended on to work properly when mounted
on the aerodrome frame, in which there was a constant, though minute, tremor
due to the high speed and power of the engine.</p>

<p>The completed frame, which is perhaps best shown in Plates <a href="#plt049">49</a>,
<a href="#plt050">50</a> and <a href="#plt051">51</a>,
and Plate <a href="#plt060">60</a>, Figs. 1, 2 and 3, in spite of its size gave an appearance of grace
and strength which is inadequately represented in the photographs. In making
the designs for the large aerodrome no data were available for use in calculating
the strains that would come on the different parts of the frame while
in the air, and the size and thickness of the tubes and the strength of the guy-wires
were consequently determined almost entirely by “rule of thumb,” backed
by experience with the models. Although the dimensions, shape, and arrangement
of most of the auxiliary parts of the machine were considerably changed
during the course of construction in accordance with the indications of the exhaustive
series of shop tests, the fundamental features of the construction were
practically unaltered, but the changes in the guy-wire system and in the fittings
by which they were attached, made the frame as a whole several times as
strong as it was originally, and it was felt that the direction of further improvements
in it would be shown only by actual test of it in flight where any weaknesses
would be certain to manifest themselves.</p>

<p>It may be well to remark here that even with the data which were later obtained,
judgment based on experience proved after all to be the safest guide for
proportioning the strength of the various parts. It can be assumed that a live
stress will produce a strain ten times as great as that due to a static stress on
the part when the machine is stationary. For greater safety, it would be still
better to assume a strain twenty times as great. If one is building bridges,
houses, and similar structures, where weight is not a prime consideration, it
would be criminal negligence to fail to provide a sufficient “factor of safety,”
or what in many instances may be more properly termed a “factor of ignorance,”
while at the present time the insistence on large factors of safety in
machines intended to fly would so enormously increase the weight that, before
one-half the necessary parts were provided, the weight would be many times
what could possibly be supported in the air. Later, no doubt, as experience is
gained in properly handling the machine in the air,
increased strength entailing <span class="xxpn" id="p187">[p187]</span>
increased weight may be added in proportion to the skill acquired; and there
is no doubt that man will acquire this skill with marvelous rapidity, approaching,
if not equaling, that exhibited by him in the use of the bicycle, which,
when first ridden, requires not only all of the rider’s skill but that of a couple
of assistants, but when once mastered requires hardly more thought for its
proper manipulation than even the act of walking involves, the balancing and
guiding being done intuitively merely by the motion of the body and with practically
no exertion.</p>

<h3 title="Chapter VI.
Construction of Supporting Surfaces.">CHAPTER VI<br />
CONSTRUCTION OF SUPPORTING SURFACES
</h3></div>

<p>An examination of the wings of birds, whether those of soarers or of any
other type, impresses one not only with the general strength of the wing, but
also with the fact that, while it possesses considerable stiffness, there is also a
graduated pliability, not only of the whole wing, including the bones, but more
especially in the feathers, the rear tips being exceedingly pliable so that, when
the wing is held in a stiff breeze, they are seen to be easily deflected in a gentle
curve towards the rear and upper side. This lack of rigidity has several advantages,
among the more notable of which is the lessening of the strains on
the wing caused by sudden wind gusts. Of great importance is the further fact
that a supporting surface having a graduated pliability, such as is possessed
by a bird’s wing, does not experience a shifting of the center of pressure to
the same extent as a rigid surface of similar form. Furthermore, since any
bird, even the best soarer, must use its wings not only for soaring, but, when
starting to fly from a state of rest, for flapping, a rigid surface would not
furnish anything like the same universally available sustaining and propelling
means that the bird’s wing does.</p>

<p>In an inspection of the various wings or supporting surfaces which Mr.
Langley built, from the very earliest rubber-pull models up to the successful
steam machines Nos. 5 and 6, the point which is most impressed upon the observer
is the increasing strength and rigidity embodied in these wings. While
the success with the later models was due to many things, including the development
of a strong frame and a suitable power plant giving sufficient power
for the permissible weight, besides the very important development of effective
equilibrium mechanism, yet it is safe to say that even with the development
of all these other things to the state to which they had been brought in 1896,
success would not have been achieved had not the wings themselves been simultaneously
changed from the very flimsy construction which was at first used to the
later type, using a very strong and rigid wooden frame over which the cloth covering
was tightly stretched, and which possessed only a small amount of pliability
at the extreme rear ends of the cross-ribs.</p>

<p>The development of this successful type of wing for the models, it will be
remembered, had been achieved only after an extensive series of experiments;
and it was realized that the construction of suitable wings for the large aerodrome,
even with the knowledge gained in the early work, would be still more <span class="xxpn" id="p189">[p189]</span>
difficult. The problem was that of constructing for a very little greater weight
per square foot, wings containing approximately sixteen times the area of the
model wings.</p>

<p>It will be recalled from the previous description of model Aerodrome No.
5, that its four wings had a combined area of 68 square feet and weighed approximately
2500 grammes, or 37 grammes per square foot. It was not expected
that the large wings would be of so light a weight per square foot,
which would have meant only about 35,500 grammes (approximately 78 pounds)
weight for the 960 square feet originally planned. It was hoped, however, that
the increase in weight per square foot for the large wings would be less than
the square root of the increased linear dimensions. In this case, the increase
in linear dimensions being approximately four, it was, therefore, hoped that
the larger wings would not have quite twice the weight per square foot of the
smaller ones; the computed weight permissible for the large wings was therefore
placed at 120 pounds.</p>

<p>To obtain the required area within the permissible limits of weight two
well-defined paths of procedure were open: First, it was possible to so modify
the structural form of the wing as to obtain the advantage of the increased
strength of trussed structures, that is, by superposing the wings. Or, second,
the “single-tier” type of wing, the efficiency of which had been fairly well determined,
could be retained, and strength gained without increase of weight by
improving the method of constructing the wooden framework and by extending
the system of guy-wires.</p>

<p>Some knowledge of the superposed type of supporting surfaces had already
been gained by the experiments at Allegheny and the tests of the rubber-driven
models, in which superposed wings had frequently been used; but it was felt
that this knowledge was altogether inadequate to aid in determining either
whether the superposed type of construction possessed in practice the advantages
which theory would indicate, or how and at what distance apart the surfaces
should be superposed to obtain the best results. In order to obtain the
desired information, a series of tests on the whirling-table of complete wings
suitable for use on the models was made. These experiments were supplemented
by the practical tests with the models, which have already been described in
Chapter III <a href="#tocontents">◊</a>, in order to give the wings a trial under the conditions of flight,
where they would be subjected to the action of the propellers and the uneven
character of the wind.</p>

<p>In addition to determining what type of construction and what form of
surface would give the greatest “lift” with the smallest “drift,” these whirling-table
tests supplied data as to how much greater the actual resistance of
the wing with its necessary guy-posts and guy-wires was than the theoretical
resistance, found by extrapolation from the
results obtained in the tests of rigid <span class="xxpn" id="p190">[p190]</span>
curved surfaces formed of wood. The first of this series of tests, the results
of which are given below, was made November 30, 1898, on the superposed wing
shown in Plate <a href="#plt037">37</a>, Figs. 1 and 2. It should be noted, however, that when this test
was made the wing was not provided with the stiffening strips or the vertical
partitions.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Weight of wing&#160;= 1000 grammes; weight of guy-posts, etc.,&#160;= 475
grammes; distance of mean center of gravity of guy-posts, etc., from

<p>The very interesting phenomenon was noted in this test that the “drift”
or resistance of the wing seemed to remain unchanged at soaring speed at different
angles of elevation. It is hardly probable that this result is accurate,
for the “balance arm” undoubtedly twisted under the action of the wing, and
this caused it to strain on its pivots, and thus, to a certain extent, falsify the
record as to drift.</p>

<p>A test of a single-tier wing at different angles of elevation was made
on December 6, 1898. This wing was nearly the same as those used in actual
flights of Aerodromes Nos. 5 and 6 in May and November, 1896, the wing being
of the same width fore and aft, but somewhat shorter. The actual wing
was a little too long to permit its being used on the whirling-table in the limited
space of the shop.</p>

<p>In this test it is to be noted that the “drift,” or resistance, while considerably
greater at soaring speed for 2 degrees than for 5 degrees, remains practically
the same between 5 degrees and
<span class="mixfract">12<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">2</span></span></span>
degrees. Comparing it with the
preceding test with the superposed wing, it is seen that at soaring speed at an
angle of 10 degrees, the single-tier wing having a load of 0.112 pounds per <span class="xxpn" id="p191">[p191]</span>
square foot, has only 129 grammes drift, while the superposed one, while
supporting 0.125 pounds per square foot, has 255 grammes drift. Moreover,
the soaring speed of the single-tier wing is only 11.6 feet per second,
while the superposed one requires a speed of 13 feet per second.</p>

<p>As the superposed wing tested on November 30 was so weak structurally
that it could not be made to keep its proper shape without adding an excessive
number of guy-wires, it was decided that it was not adapted for use on the
aerodrome, but before abandoning it the partitions and strips were added and it
was again tested on the whirling-table on March 1, 1899, with the following
results:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Weight of wing&#160;= 905 grammes; weight of guy-posts, etc.,&#160;= 320

<p>During the tests on the whirling-table this type of construction seemed to
be exceedingly strong and stiff, and to be easily maintained in whatever position
it was placed. It was therefore thought that it would prove strong enough
for the aerodrome, and it was accordingly inverted
and given a “sanding test” <span class="xxpn" id="p192">[p192]</span>
by sprinkling sand uniformly over it to such a thickness as to cause it to have
a load of 0.75 pounds per square foot. As it showed no serious deflection or
change of form under the sanding test, it was decided that it was strong enough
for use in tests of the model aerodromes in actual flight.</p>

<p>Upon the completion of these whirling-table tests, the cloth covering of this
wing was painted with collodion varnish, which increased the weight of the
wing only 50 grammes. In order to make the results of its tests more easily
comparable with those obtained before varnishing, the cross guy-wires on the
wing were changed to a slightly smaller size in order to make the weight of
the wing the same as before. It was tested on March 3, and the following results
were obtained:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Weight of wing&#160;= 1025 grammes; weight of guy posts, etc.,&#160;= 320

<p>Although the varnishing of the wing seemed to have no effect on the “drift,”
the soaring speed was slightly decreased.</p>

<p>As a result of these tests it was decided to construct three more wings like
this second type, the four forming a complete set for use on the steam-driven
models Nos. 5 and 6. Although the tests on the whirling-table indicated a superior
efficiency for the “single-tier” wings, and it was not expected that in
actual use on the aerodrome the result would be different, yet it was felt that
as the conditions of actual use are so very different from those of a whirling-table
experiment it would not be safe to decide too definitely against the superposed
wings without first giving them a test under actual conditions. Aside
from the decreased lifting effect shown by the superposed wing when compared
with the “single-tier” one, it was also thought that under the actual conditions
of use on the machine the superposed wing would show up still worse.
The deflection of the air by the front wings diminishes the lift of the rear ones
even for the “single-tier” type, and this, it seemed certain, would be greatly
aggravated in the case of the superposed type.</p>

<p>In order to emphasize more fully the results of these tests the following
table is added, which gives the data for the “single-tier” wing and this second
type of superposed one, when each was tested at ten degrees angle of
elevation:</p>

<p>The first line shows the calculations for the aerodrome when equipped with
the short “single-tier” wings; the second line, when equipped with the “single-tier”
wings of the full length used in the flights of 1896; and the third line,
when equipped with superposed wings, Type No. 2.</p>

<p>It will be seen that, on the whole, the result of the comparison of the full-length
“single-tier” wing and the superposed one is less in favor of the latter
than was to be expected, as, aside from its greater structural strength, it seems
to have no real point of superiority, except that it is shorter; and, as already
pointed out, one point of presumable inferiority, though not exhibited in the
table, is the fact that the rear set of wings would suffer relatively more from
being in the lee of the front ones, in the case of the superposed wings, than in
the case of the “single-tier” ones.</p>

<p>Besides these “conventional” forms of wings, various other types were
tested on the whirling-table. The data of these tests are not given, as in the
rough preliminary tests the results were so entirely negative in character that
accurate quantitative tests were never made. However, since in work of this
kind the greatest delay is experienced in learning what not to do, and in ridding
one’s self of freak notions which are continually suggesting themselves, it
may be well here to describe sufficiently at least one of these types of wing to
enable others to avoid any loss of time in experiments with it. Since the principal
disadvantages of a wing possessing considerable width in the fore and
aft direction are due to the great extent through which the center
of pressure <span class="xxpn" id="p194">[p194]</span>
shifts when the velocity of advance or angle of incidence is changed, and to the
further fact that a wide surface does not support proportionately as much per
square foot as a long and narrow one, it was thought that some advantage
might be gained by making the covering of the wing in the form of strips,
the edges of which would be perpendicular to the direction of motion, or by
making this covering in more or less slat-like form, which would permit the air
which had already been acted upon by the leading slat to slip through between
the rear edge of the first slat and the leading edge of the succeeding one. In
the tests on the whirling-table, however, it was found that this type of construction
not only did not possess any advantages, but was even less effective than
a similar one in which the covering was continuous. The difference was probably
due to the fact that the air which passed between the slats reduced
the suction on the upper side of the following slat, and also to the fact that the
distance between the slats was not sufficient to gain the effect of having each slat
act on air which had not already been partially deflected by the preceding one.</p>

<p>In view of the results of these tests on various types of wings, it was decided
that in constructing the first set of wings for the large aerodrome it would
be best to employ the “single-tier” type, which had proved successful with
the models, and that after getting a successful flight with these the superposed
wings would be tried in order to get, if possible, the advantage which
they possessed of being structurally stronger and more compact. It was therefore
clear that any gain in the strength and rigidity of the first set of wings,
as a whole, would have to be obtained by improvements in the construction of its
integral parts, that is, in the main and cross-ribs which made up its framework.</p>

<p>Before attempting to proportion the parts of the necessary wooden wing
frame, which it was expected would probably undergo many changes before
a final design was secured which would embody maximum strength for minimum
weight, various tests were made to determine just how light a cloth covering
could be obtained which would be strong enough and sufficiently impervious
to the air. In the construction of the wings for the models a good
grade of China silk had been employed, but on account of the greatly increased
quantity of cloth required for the large wings, it was hoped that something
approximately as good as the silk could be secured at a much less cost, and
various grades of percaline were therefore tested. The weight of the various
grades of percaline ranged from three grammes to ten grammes per square
foot, the lighter samples being of a rather coarse mesh, while the heaviest
ones were not only close mesh but some specimens contained a large amount
of “sizing.” The particular grade which was finally adopted weighed
seven grammes per square foot. This material was practically impervious to air at
a pressure of one pound per square foot, which,
of course, was considerably <span class="xxpn" id="p195">[p195]</span>
more than it would be subjected to in flight. This grade of percaline weighed
approximately one and a half times as much as a grade of silk, which on test
was found to have a slightly greater tensile strength than the percaline, though
the latter did not “flute” or “pocket” nearly as much as the silk. Moreover,
the cost of the percaline was only about one-third that of the silk, and
it was chiefly for this reason that percaline was adopted in place of silk. Allowing
for necessary seams and extra material to be turned over at the front
and rear edges of the wings, the percaline covering, which under the original
plans comprised approximately 1000 square feet, was therefore calculated to
weigh approximately 7000 grammes, exclusive of the necessary cords for lacing
the coverings to the wooden frames of the wings.</p>

<p>As the one hundred and twenty pounds allowed for the four wings permitted
only thirty pounds per wing, and as the cloth covering, lacing cords,
etc., were found to weigh something over four pounds, there remained only
about 25 pounds as the permissible weight of the wooden framing, including
the necessary metal clips, secondary guy-wires, etc., for each wing. With the
relative proportions of the various parts of the wooden framing of the wings
of the models as a basis, it was decided to make the main ribs of the large
wings 1.5 inches in diameter for one-half their length, and have them taper from
this size to one inch in diameter at the extreme point. After making allowance
for the weight of these ribs, it was found that, if the cross-ribs were to
be spaced no farther than ten inches apart, and the two end ones were to be
made at least as wide as 1.5 inches in order to resist the end strain due to the
stress of the cloth, the twenty-six intermediate cross-ribs could be
only seven-sixteenths
of an inch in diameter at the point where they crossed the main rib,
and that they must be tapered to three-eighths of an inch in diameter at the
front end and to one-fourth of an inch in diameter at the rear tip.</p>

<p>A trial wing, whose total weight was 30 pounds 2 ounces, was made up with
the various parts of its frame of the above dimensions. Even upon inspection
it appeared to be too flimsy to withstand the sudden gusts of wind which were
certain to be met in actual practice. In order, however, to get some definite
data as a guide, the wing was inverted and guyed in the same way that it was
proposed to guy it on the aerodrome, and a uniform thickness of sand was then
sprinkled over it to such a depth as to give it a load of 0.7 pounds per square
foot. Even before one-quarter of the sand was sprinkled over it, it was seen
that the wing was rapidly going out of shape, and it was feared that the full
amount of sand would not only seriously distort it, but would even break it.
The full quantity of sand, however, did not break it, but distorted it to such
an extent that, had the pressure been due to its being propelled through the
air, its serious change in form would have rendered it
worse than useless. <span class="xxpn" id="p196">[p196]</span>
While the main ribs had shown a certain amount of deflection under the sanding test,
the more serious distortion had been in the cross-ribs, the small guy-wires,
which had been fastened to each cross-rib, becoming loose instead of
tight, as had been expected, since the rib tended to increase its curvature instead
of straightening out. This increase in the curvature of the cross-ribs
was partly overcome by tying the guy-wire flat against the cross-rib for a distance
of about 2 feet from the rear tip. But while this caused the guy-wire to
tighten the general contour of the wing showed very little improvement, as
the ribs now assumed a curve more or less like the letter S, the rear tip now
being bent downward to form the tail of the elongated S.</p>

<p>From this sanding test it was seen that the cross-ribs must be materially
stiffer, and a new set was accordingly made one-sixteenth of an inch larger in
diameter at the various points of measurement. Upon giving the wing, equipped
with these larger ribs, a sanding test it was found that, while there had been
some improvement, it was entirely too flimsy, even when it been double-guyed
by running a second wire on each cross-rib from the middle of the portion
in front of the mid-rib to the middle of the portion behind the mid-rib.
As the weight of the wing with these larger solid cross-ribs had now increased
to more than 33 pounds, and the wing had proved itself altogether too weak
for use on the aerodrome, it was evident that some other plan of constructing
the ribs which would give greater strength for the same weight must be found.
At first sight it might appear that the obvious way of increasing the stiffness
of the cross-ribs was to employ a cross-section other than a round one, since
material added to the depth of the rib is very much more effective than if
added to the width. It must, however, be remembered that these cross-ribs
were 11 feet long, and that, as the main mid-rib was 6 feet in front of the
rear tips of the cross-ribs, with no intermediate bracing, except the light threads
by which the cloth cover was attached, it was inevitable that, should the depth
be made materially greater than the width, the rib would buckle sideways.
Test ribs of I-beam form, which are later described, were constructed, but, although
they proved exceedingly stiff, had to be discarded.</p>

<p>In view of these facts the obvious remedy appeared to be to make the rib
hollow, and one cross-rib,
<span class="fract"><span class="fup">3</span><span class="fdn">4</span></span>
of an inch in diameter at the point where it crossed
the main rib, tapering to
<span class="fract"><span class="fup">5</span><span class="fdn">8</span></span>
of an inch at the front and
<span class="fract"><span class="fup">3</span><span class="fdn">8</span></span>
of an inch at the rear
tip, was accordingly constructed. Tests showed that this form of rib, which
was about 10 grammes lighter than the
<span class="nowrap"><span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">2</span></span>-inch</span>
solid ribs, was much stiffer
than anything yet constructed. But when a wing, with cross-ribs of this size placed
20 inches apart, was sanded it was found that, although a great advance in
construction had been made, still further improvement was necessary before a
suitable wing for the large aerodrome could be procured.
<span class="xxpn" id="p197">[p197]</span></p>

<p>Before proceeding with the construction of any more complete wings, an
extended series of experiments was made in order to secure ribs of proper lightness
and strength. Various forms of metal tubes were tested; but, although
aluminum seemed at one time to promise good results, it was found that hollow
ribs could be constructed of spruce which were much stronger than aluminum
tubes of the same weight. In order to determine more accurately what mode
of construction would give the greatest stiffness and strength for a minimum
weight, it was decided to make up some test pieces of different forms before
making up complete ribs. For convenience in construction, these test pieces
were made straight and shorter than the large cross-ribs. Each piece was
tested by fastening it in the testing clamp with 1 metre of its length projecting
horizontally, and attaching at its end a weight of 1 kilogramme. The deflection
from the horizontal gave an index of the stiffness of the piece under
examination.</p>

<p>The first test piece was a hollow square, 17 mm. length of side on the exterior,
and 11 mm. length of side on the interior, the walls thus being 3 mm.
thick. This weighed 73 grammes per metre and had small internal stiffening
pieces, like the partitions in bamboo, glued into it 4 inches apart. A weight of
1 kilogramme at the distance of 1 metre gave a deflection of 56 mm. The second
test piece was a duplicate of the first one, except that it had no internal
stiffening pieces, and the weight per metre was made the same, 73 grammes, as
formerly, by leaving the walls a fraction thicker. The deflection in this case
was, as would be expected, exactly the same as in the first one. The first test
piece, however, was superior to the second one in that it was stiffer against being
crushed in by accident. The third test piece was a hollow cylinder, 22 mm.
outside diameter and 17 mm. inside diameter, the walls thus being 2.5 mm. thick.
The weight per metre was 91 grammes, and the deflection was 46 mm. The
fourth test was made by taking two of the original solid cross-ribs, 12 mm. in
diameter, and fastening them in the clamp side by side, with a length of 1 metre
projecting. The weight per metre for the two ribs was 105 grammes, and the
deflection produced on the two by 1 kilogramme at 1 metre distance was 115 mm.
The fifth test piece was an I-beam of spruce, having a depth of 25 mm., with
the flanges 12.5 mm. wide and the web 3 mm. thick. The weight per metre was
65 grammes, and the deflection was 26 mm. All of these test pieces were made
of carefully selected straight-grained spruce.</p>

<p>It is readily seen that the test piece having the I-beam section weighed less
than the hollow square in the first and second tests, and had a deflection of less
than half. This I-beam section, however, did not show up so well when a longer
piece was tested, for as soon as the length was made appreciably greater than
a metre it began to twist, the twisting becoming more
and more serious the <span class="xxpn" id="p198">[p198]</span>
greater the length, until with a piece 11 feet long, the full length of a cross-rib,
the twisting was so serious as to make the rib practically useless. It was
at first thought that this twisting might be overcome by making the webs slightly
wider, and it would to a certain extent, but in looking ahead and planning how
the cross-ribs were to be fastened to the main ribs, the I-beam section was seen
to present so many difficulties that it was thought hardly worth while to spend
time on further experiments with it. This decision was made all the more imperative
by foreseeing the difficulty of bending the I-beam section to the curve
which the cross-ribs were to have. In fact it had been found by experience
that while many different forms of ribs could be bent to the proper curve by
steaming and clamping them over a form and then drying them out while still
clamped to the form, yet the grain of the wood varied so in different ribs, that
of a dozen steamed and bent over the same form it was seldom that as many
as three would have approximately the same amount of curvature when removed
from the form after drying. If, however, the curve was formed in the
ribs by making them in two parts, which were glued together and clamped up
on the form while the glue dried, practically any number could be made which
would have the same curvature when thinned down to the proper thickness of
wall.</p>

<p>It was recognized at all times that the gluing together of the ribs not only
entailed extra work, but introduced an element of uncertainty unless some
kind of a varnish for the ribs could be found which would prevent any possibility
of the glue becoming soft from moisture in the atmosphere or from the
wings actually coming down into the water when the aerodrome was tried in
flight. A search was therefore made for a varnish that was water-proof. A
large number of different varnishes were tried, and one was finally found which,
after repeated tests, seemed to be thoroughly good. Several test ribs were
given three coats of this varnish, and were then kept immersed in water for 24
hours without the glue showing any signs of softening. It was therefore decided
to follow the plan of gluing the ribs together and protecting them with
three coats of this varnish, which seemed to possess the remarkable properties
of being not only impervious to water, but also unaffected by the application
of concentrated ammonia or of gasoline, either of which produces immediate
softening when applied to ordinary varnishes.</p>

<p>Following the indication of these tests that the hollow, round section, 22
mm. outside diameter by 17 mm. inside diameter, would probably give the best
cross-rib for the weight that it seemed possible to allow, a set of cross-ribs of
this form was constructed and put in place in the large experimental wing, in
which the former solid ribs had been tested. The wing was inverted and fastened
into two posts at the angle it would have in flight, the guy-wires from the <span class="xxpn" id="p199">[p199]</span>
lower guy-posts of the aerodrome being represented by wires stretched from
the posts. In actual use on the aerodrome it was proposed to have three main
guy-wires running from each of the main cross-ribs to the lower guy-post, but
in the test, which is now to be described, the wires which would have come nearest
the body of the machine were left off to see what effect their removal would
have on the wing.</p>

<p>The weight and dimensions of the wing, as set up, were as follows: Length
of the main ribs, 24 feet; length of the cloth covering, 22 feet; width of the
cloth covering, 11 feet; total weight, 29 pounds. The two main ribs (front rib
and mid-rib) were solid, 3.5 cm. in diameter at butt, 2.5 cm. in diameter at tip,
and tapering from the middle to the tip. There were twelve regular cross-ribs
set 50.8 cm. (20 inches) apart, each rib being as above described, 11 feet long,
22 mm. outside diameter by 17 mm. inside diameter at the butt, and tapering
from where they were attached to the mid-rib to the tip, and each weighing
300 grammes. There were two extra cross-ribs, one at the inner end next to
the body of the machine and the other at the outer end. These were solid strips
of wood 3.8 cm. wide by 1.2 cm. thick, made extra wide and stiff in order to withstand
the strain of stretching the cloth covering. There was also a thin, flat
strip at the rear edge, which connected together all the tips of the cross-ribs,
holding them a uniform distance apart, and also serving to fasten the cloth.
The main mid-rib was stiffened in a vertical direction by a system of small guy-wires
drawn over short guy-posts about 6 inches high. With the wing inverted
and fastened in the way above described, a weight of 2 kilogrammes placed at
the inner rear corner produced a deflection of 26.7 cm. When the inner rear
corner was pulled up by a spring balance until the balance registered 2 kilogrammes,
there was an upward deflection of 41.3 cm. When the main mid-rib
was held at the inner end, the pull of 2 kilogrammes, applied to the inner corner
as before, caused an upward deflection of 25.4 cm. instead of 41.3 cm. This
wing was afterwards given a sanding test under a weight of 0.7 pound per
square foot. With fine guy-wires fastened from the front of the cross-ribs to
the tip and drawn just taut, the ribs showed an average deflection of 9 inches at
the tip under the above weight. When a small wooden guy-post was added
under each of these small guy-wires, the same weight produced an average deflection
of 5 inches at the tip of each rib under the same load. In a previous
test of the wing, using hollow cross-ribs 16 mm. outside diameter by 10 mm. inside
diameter at the butt, and only half as far apart as the later ones, a load
of 1 pound per square foot on the wing produced an average deflection of 9
inches at the tip of each rib when the cross guy-wires on each rib were held
up by short guy-posts, but when these short guy-posts were removed, the same
load produced a deflection of nearly 25 inches at the tip of each rib.
<span class="xxpn" id="p200">[p200]</span></p>

<p>Although this wing was a great improvement in every way over any of the
previous constructions, it was felt that it was too weak for the large aerodrome.
Further experiments were therefore made in order to secure a form of cross-rib
which would meet the rigorous requirements imposed. An inordinate amount
of time was spent in the construction and tests of various forms of rib, but as
a result a satisfactory cross-rib was at last constructed of the form shown in
Plate <a href="#plt066">66</a>, Figs. 4–8, the dimensions at the three principal points, viz., first, where
the cross-ribs join the front rib; second, where they cross the mid-rib; and third,
at the rear tip, being given both for the intermediate cross-ribs and the end
cross-ribs.</p>

<p>Following the plan employed by Nature in the construction of the bamboo
pole, small partitions, approximately one millimetre thick, were placed every
three inches in the thin, hollow rib to keep it from being crushed. The partitions
were glued in place when the hollow rib was glued together on the form
around which it was bent and clamped until the glue dried. Longer blocks were
also inserted in each of the intermediate ribs at the point where it crossed the
main rib and also at the front end where it was attached to the front rib. In
the end ribs blocks were also inserted at the points where the cross-braces were
fastened to them for resisting the end stress due to the cloth covering.</p>

<p>Upon making up one of these ribs and testing it, it was found to possess
remarkable stiffness, so much so that it was thought probable that it was as
stiff in proportion to its size as the best thing that Nature had produced in the
bird’s wing. A large quill from the wing of a harpy eagle was therefore
stripped and the large end clamped in a special holder, and measurements were
made of the deflection produced by weights at various distances from the clamp.
As the main mid-rib of the wing of the aerodrome is placed approximately at
the point of the center of pressure, the bending action on the cross-ribs may be
assumed to act on a lever arm from the mid-rib towards the front, and from
the mid-rib towards the rear in the cases of the pressure on the front and rear
portions of the wing, respectively. In testing these cross-ribs, therefore, against
the quill, the rib was clamped at the point where it crosses the mid-rib of the
wing, and measurements were made of the deflection produced by weights placed
at various distances from the point of clamping both front and rear.</p>

<p>The quill on which the measurements were made was 19.5 inches long and
had a gradual curve, the highest point of the curve being about the center of
the length of the quill, and the depth of curvature being about 2 inches. When
the butt of this quill was placed in the clamp the tip stood 17 cm. above the
horizontal. The hollow spruce rib, when clamped at a point 5 feet from the
tip (the point from which it tapers in both directions) had its tip 2.2 cm. above
the horizontal, there being very little curve in that portion of the rib. The
quill weighed 4 grammes when stripped and 18 inches
of it projected from the <span class="xxpn" id="p201">[p201]</span>
clamp which held it during the tests. The rear portion of the spruce rib projected
5 feet from the clamp, being thus 3.3 times as long as the quill, and it
weighed 120 grammes, the weight for the larger size having, therefore, increased
slightly less than the cube of the length.</p>

<p>In each case the unit of length was the portion extending beyond the clamp;
the unit of weight, the greatest weight employed to produce the deflection. It
should be noted, however, that the relative deflection was quite different in the
two comparisons. In the case of the quill the deflection was 17 cm. in 45 cm., or
38 per cent; in the case of the rib it was 17 cm. in 153 cm., or 11 per cent. In
the case of the rib at the point 0.39 the absolute weight was 15,000 grammes,
the relative weight unity and the deflection in terms of length 0.11. While no
rigorous comparison can be instituted, since the rib was not deflected nearly as
much proportionately as the quill, yet the general inference is that while the
rib was not intended to be, and was not as elastic proportionately as the quill,
it was probably at least as strong in proportion to its weight. Briefly summarizing
these results it will be noted that the spruce rib was about 3.3 times
the length and 30 times as heavy, while it was 15 times as stiff near the butt and
26 times as stiff at the tip, as the quill.</p>

<p>As this test on the rib for the large wings had apparently shown that the
plan of constructing the ribs in the form of a hollow square secured maximum
strength for minimum weight, it was decided to construct a few sample ribs
after the same plan for the wings of the new quarter-size model of the large
aerodrome, and to test, these ribs in a similar manner. The following table
shows the results of the test on one of these ribs:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Total length of rib&#160;= 80 cm. Curve&#160;= 1 in 18. Highest point of

point of attachment to mid-rib, tapering to 8 mm.&#160;× 12 mm. at the front
point and to 7 mm.&#160;× 2 mm. at the tip. The rib was clamped with the tip
projecting <span class="xxpn" id="p202">[p202]</span>
46 cm. and was weighted at different percentages of its length to
such an extent that it was deflected 11 per cent of its length, or 5
cm. The weight of the 46 cm. length of rib which projected from the
clamp was 11 grammes, the whole rib weighing 22 grammes and balancing
on a knife edge placed at the point where it was clamped.</p></div>

80 cm. long, but was only one-half the linear dimensions in section of the rib

<p>Among quite a number of different forms of cross-ribs which were constructed
of a size suitable for use in the model aerodrome, but made primarily
for use in tests to determine the best form to employ, may be mentioned the
following, in which both ribs were seven-sixteenths of an inch outside diameter
and five-sixteenths of an inch inside diameter. One was filled with elder
pith, formed up into a round rod that just fit the interior of the hollow rib, and
was glued into it when the rib was glued up. The other rib was left hollow.
Upon testing these by suspending weights at different points,
the rib without <span class="xxpn" id="p203">[p203]</span>
the pith showed a slightly less deflection than the one with it, it happening
probably that the wood in one case was a little stiffer than in the other, although
they were carefully selected to be as nearly alike as possible. The rib
with the pith in it weighed 34 grammes and the one without it weighed 30
grammes. It was inferred from this test that the placing of a light pithy material
in the interior of the ribs would have no good effect, and would not only
add weight, but also complicate the construction. The reason for making this
test with pith in one of the ribs was that it was thought probable that the rib
flattened out somewhat when it was deflected under a load, and that the pith
stiffened with the glue with which it was fastened in, might lessen this.</p>

<p>As the cross-rib described above, which was tested on October 23, 1899,
seemed in every way suited for use in the wings of the large aerodrome, a complete
wing equipped with similar ribs but of slightly changed dimensions, as
shown in Plate <a href="#plt066">66</a>, Fig. 5, was immediately constructed. As previous tests had
shown that the wing covering did not “flute” or “pocket” to any considerable
extent even when the ribs were as much as thirty inches apart, only ten cross-ribs
were used in this wing. The eight intermediate cross-ribs were of the
form described above, but the ribs at either end of the wing were made of a
larger cross-section and otherwise stiffened in order to resist the strain of the
tightly stretched cloth covering.</p>

<p>On April 13, 1900, a final sanding test was made on this wing, guyed in a
manner similar to that used in the aerodrome, in which the following results
were obtained:</p>

<p>The weight of sand put on the wing in this test was 1.5 times as great as
the pressure which at this time it was expected would be imposed upon it in
flight, and was in fact 1.2 times as great as the normal pressure when supporting
the aerodrome as finally constructed. Even under this weight the greatest
deflection noted in terms of the total length of the rib was less than 0.10, showing
that the elastic limit of the rib was far from being reached.
<span class="xxpn" id="p204">[p204]</span></p>

<p>As this test seemed to indicate that the wings constructed in this manner
were certainly strong and rigid enough for use on the aerodrome, and that immediate
further improvement could hardly be made, three similar wings were
at once constructed to complete the set. Somewhat later two additional wings
were provided, so that when the large aerodrome was taken to Widewater on
the Potomac in 1903 one and a half complete sets of wings were on hand, which
seemed to be ample to provide for any emergencies that might arise.</p>

<p>Each of these wings had, as is clearly shown in the drawings, Plates <a href="#plt053">53</a> and
54, two main ribs, which formed the main strength of the framework and gave
the wing longitudinal rigidity. To the main front rib were attached the cross-ribs
and the pieces for the curved extension later described. The mid-rib extended
across the cross-ribs, parallel to and about 5 feet behind the front rib,
this being approximately the line in which lay the center of pressure of the
wing. It was upon this rib, therefore, that the greatest strain would fall.</p>

<p>The mid-rib, Plate <a href="#plt066">66</a>, Fig. 2, was 731.5 cm. (24 ft.) long, having at the butt
an outer diameter of 38 mm. (1.5 in.) and an inner diameter of 25 mm. (1 in.),
the walls being, therefore, approximately 6.5 mm. (0.25 in.) thick. From the
butt to the middle point the section was uniform, but from this point it had a
taper of one-twenty-fourth of an inch to the foot, so that at the tip it had an
outer diameter of 25 mm. (1 in.), the thickness of the wall being unchanged. At
the butt end a wooden block 8 inches long was glued inside the rib, and at uniform
distances of 75 mm. (30 in.) 10 smaller blocks were glued in where the
cross-ribs were attached. The main front rib was of the same form and size,
except that it was some 2 inches shorter and had no blocks, except the long one
at the butt, glued in it.</p>

<p>To these main ribs were attached, in the manner later described, the 10
cross-ribs, to which the cloth cover was attached. The 8 intermediate cross-ribs
have already been described in connection with the tests. The cross-ribs at
the end of the wings, upon which greater lateral strains would come from the
stretching of the cloth, were made of the larger cross-section shown in Fig. 8
of Plate <a href="#plt066">66</a>. Additional longitudinal stiffness was provided by gluing a strip
2 mm. thick between the upper and lower halves, as shown in the section. These
end ribs, as well as those next to the ends, had small blocks glued into them
where they were crossed by the diagonal braces, in addition to the small partitions
1 mm. thick, which were glued into the ribs every 3 inches to prevent crushing,
and the blocks 2.5 and 3 inches long respectively, where they were attached
to the front rib and to the mid-rib. At the extreme rear edge of the wing the
cross-ribs were attached to the small “D”-rib, which served to hold the ribs
at equal distances and to keep the cloth cover stretched tight. This “D”-rib,
as shown in Plate <a href="#plt066">66</a>, Fig. 3, had semi-circular walls 4 mm. thick, 21 mm. in diameter,
to the edge of which was glued a flat strip 3 mm. thick.
<span class="xxpn" id="p205">[p205]</span></p>

<p>As originally designed the wings had a curve of only 1 in 18, the main
front rib forming the leading edge of the wing. Later, however, it seemed desirable
to “quicken” the curve and at the same time give the wing a sharper
leading edge. This was accomplished by attaching to the front rib, at the points
where the cross-ribs joined it, properly curved wooden pieces of the form shown
in Plate <a href="#plt066">66</a>, Fig. 10, over which the cloth cover of the wing was stretched. The
curve of the wing after the addition of this extension is shown in Plate <a href="#plt066">66</a>,
Fig. 4, and was a curve having a rise of approximately 1 in 12, with the highest
point .25 from the front end.</p>

<p>On account of the large size of these wings and the consequent difficulty in
handling them it was necessary to construct them in such a manner that they
could be easily taken apart, rolled up, transported to the house-boat or any
other point where they might need to be used, and then quickly reassembled.
After much experiment as to the best means of constructing them, the following
plan was devised. The cloth covering was permanently fastened to the front
rib, to which were attached the front extension pieces by means of small metal
clips secured by small wood screws. On the rear edge of the front main rib,
at a uniform distance of 30 inches apart, 10 small metal horns of 1-mm. tubing,
5 cm. long, each brazed to an independent clamping thimble, as shown in Fig.
9 of Plate <a href="#plt066">66</a>, were fastened. The front end of each of the cross-ribs was
slightly rounded out to fit the front main rib, and in the wooden block which
was glued in this end of the cross-rib a hole was bored to fit these horns. Each
of the cross-ribs was then pushed over its proper horn and against the front
main rib, and the cloth covering then drawn back toward the rear tips of the
cross-ribs. In the extreme rear edge of the cloth covering a seam was made,
and in this was inserted the “D”-rib already described. The cloth was then
tightly stretched and a wood screw forced through the “D”-rib and into and
through the metal ferrule at the tip of the cross-rib. Near the inner and outer
edges of the cloth covering eyelets were placed about 6 inches apart, through
which small cords were then inserted and tied to the end cross-ribs. The main
or mid-rib was then placed on top of the cross-ribs and fastened to them with
wood screws, and the cross-braces were then fastened on the top of the wing, as
shown in Plate <a href="#plt054">54</a>. The frame of the wing was stiffened horizontally by cross
guy-wires which passed from each cross-rib, at the point where the mid-rib
crossed it, to the adjoining cross-rib, at the point where it was connected to
the front rib. Each of the main ribs was individually guyed, in the manner
clearly shown in Plate <a href="#plt052">52</a>, in order to stiffen it in the vertical direction, the fittings
for these guy-wires being shown in detail in Figs. 11–15 of Plate <a href="#plt066">66</a>. Finally,
small guy-wires were run from the front end of the cross-ribs over a
guy-post 12 inches high at the point where the cross-rib crossed the mid-rib
to the rear tip of the cross-rib. These cross guy-wires were
regulated in <span class="xxpn" id="p206">[p206]</span> tightness
by raising and lowering a screw in the slot of the head of which they rested,
and which was threaded in the end of the small guy-post. Upper and lower guy-wires,
running from the main ribs to the guy-posts on the aerodrome, as already
described, and as is clearly shown in the drawings, Plates <a href="#plt052">52</a> and
<a href="#plt054">54</a>, completed
the guy-wire system for the wings, except for the “drift wires,” which
for the front wings were run from the lower side of the mid-rib to the bowsprit
at the front of the machine, and for the rear wings to the main frame.</p>

<p>Each wing when completely assembled weighed approximately 29 pounds,
and had a rectangular surface 22.5 by 11.5 feet (measured on the chord of the
curve), or 260 square feet, making the weight per square foot equal about 50
grammes, rather less than 1.5 times as much per square foot as the wings for
the steam-driven models. The total supporting surface of the aerodrome was
1040 square feet, and as the aerodrome when equipped for flight weighed, including
the aviator, 850 pounds this gave 1.22 square feet to the pound, or 0.82
pound to the square foot. Although this was a somewhat larger proportion
of weight to supporting surface than it had originally been expected to have,
there is every reason to believe that it was sufficient, for the quarter-size model,
when weighted so that it had 1.22 square feet to the pound, flew well, as will
later appear.</p>

<h3 title="Chapter VII.
Equilibrium and Control.">CHAPTER VII<br />
EQUILIBRIUM AND CONTROL
</h3></div>

<p>In an aerodrome it is essential not only that its component parts shall be
so disposed that the initial equilibrium is correct and highly stable, but also
that some efficient means be provided for quickly and accurately restoring the
equilibrium, if for any reason it is disturbed. If the aerodrome is of sufficient
size and power to carry a human being it is, of course, possible merely to supply
an efficient means of controlling the lateral and horizontal equilibrium of
the machine and depend upon the intelligence and skill of the operator, as developed
by practice and experience, to maintain the proper equilibrium of the
machine while in the air. This method, however, is open to the objection that no
matter how skilled the aviator may be there remains the probability of a serious
if not fatal accident as the result of any momentary lapse or diversion of
attention until the “sense of equilibrium” has been developed. One of the
chief problems, therefore, which had impressed itself from the beginning of
the work, was to devise some means by which the equilibrium of the aerodrome
would be automatically maintained under the varying conditions of flight, so as
to leave the aviator free, as far as possible, to control the direction of flight
and to devote his attention to other important matters connected with the
proper functioning of the various parts of the aerodrome. In the development
of the models it had been absolutely necessary to develop some efficient
automatic control, as they were far too small to carry an aviator, and the conditions
of flight in the open air, even on the calmest day, were such that constant
readjustments of the equilibrium were necessary. The success attained
in the automatic control of the equilibrium of the models had been so great,
and so much time would have been required for an aviator to acquire skill
sufficient to control a machine without such automatic equilibrium, that it was
considered both expedient and safe to embody in the large aerodrome the plans
which had proved so successful in the models. It was necessary, however, to
provide in addition in the large machine means whereby the aviator could quickly
and accurately either modify the action of the automatic devices or, if desired,
entirely supersede the automatic control by purely manual control. Three distinct
problems were, therefore, encountered in connection with the equilibrium
and control of the large aerodrome. In the first place, the machine as a whole
had to be so designed, and its component parts so disposed as to secure a highly
stable initial equilibrium; second, automatic
means had to be provided for <span class="xxpn" id="p208">[p208]</span> maintaining
this equilibrium under the varying conditions of flight and for restoring
it if for any reason it was disturbed, and, finally, provision had to be made
for the quick and accurate control of the flight by the aviator. These problems,
while intimately related, had to be met one by one and solved separately.</p>

<p>The general type of machine adopted was that which had been developed in
the years of experiment with the steam-driven models. From the very first
consideration of the large aerodrome, it seemed advisable to follow this type,
which not only had shown itself to be distinguished by remarkable longitudinal
and lateral stability in the tests, but was actually the only type in the world
which had at that time shown any possibility of successful flight. There was,
of course, a question whether single surface or superposed wings would be used,
and in spite of the negative results obtained in the tests of the models with
the superposed wings, it was felt that a considerable field for development was
open in this direction. However, in spite of the advantages which theoretical
considerations showed might be obtained through the introduction of this and
various other modifications of the original type, the whole teaching of past experience
in the construction of the model aerodromes had been that success was
more certain to be achieved by following the course in which genuine practical
results had been achieved. It was decided, therefore, that in the construction
of the large aerodrome the design should follow as closely as constructional conditions
would permit the lines of the successful model Aerodromes Nos. 5 and
6, which have already been fully described.</p>

<p>The longitudinal stability of an aerodrome is largely dependent upon the
relation of three chief factors; the center of pressure, the center of gravity and
the line of thrust. For an aerodrome of the “Langley” type, the relative positions
of these which give the greatest degree of stability had been determined
as far as possible through the years of experiment with the models. However,
while it is the usual experience in designing machinery, or even scientific
apparatus, that what appears theoretically to be the best plan has to be
considerably modified for constructional reasons, yet in the design of an aerodrome
this is particularly true, for not only must all the various parts function
properly, both separately and as a whole, but this result must be secured for
the very minimum of weight. Experience alone can enable one to appreciate
thoroughly how seriously this consideration of weight complicates the problem.</p>

<p>In making the original designs for the large aerodrome it had been recognized
that the relative positions of the line of thrust, center of pressure, and
center of gravity were much better in model No. 6 than in model No. 5. From
Data Sheet No. 1, for Aerodrome No. 5 when it made its flight on May 6, 1896,
it will be noted that the line of thrust being assumed
to be at the point 1500,<a id="fnanchor_43" href="#footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a>
<span class="xxpn" id="p209">[p209]</span>
the center of gravity was at the point 1497, and that, assuming the rear wings
to have two-thirds of the lifting effect of the front ones, the center of pressure
was calculated to be at the point 1498, or one centimetre in front of the center
of gravity, measured in the horizontal plane. In the vertical plane the center
of pressure was calculated to be at the point 2536, and the center of gravity
was found by test to be at the point 2501, when the line of thrust was assumed
to be at the point 2500, the center of gravity being actually one centimetre above
the line of thrust.</p>

<p>From the data sheet of Aerodrome No. 6, for its flight of November 28,
1896, it will be noted that the line of thrust being at the point 1500 the center
of pressure was at the point 1487, and the center of gravity at the point 1484;
that is, the center of pressure was three centimeters in front of the center of
gravity, measured in the horizontal plane. In the vertical plane, taking the line
of thrust at the point 2500, the center of pressure was at the point 2525, and
the center of gravity at the point 2486, the center of gravity being 14 centimetres
<em class="italic">below</em> the line of thrust and 39 centimetres below the center of pressure,
the distance from the center of pressure to the line of thrust being, therefore,
64 per cent of the distance between the center of pressure and the center of
gravity.</p>

<p>As has been explained in Part I, while it is not desirable that the center of
gravity be a great distance below the center of pressure, as such a relation
tends to produce a special kind of rolling and pitching in varying currents of
air, it is highly desirable that the center of gravity should lie some distance
below the line of thrust in order that the three forces may be balanced. In a
machine like model No. 5, where the center of gravity was actually, though
very slightly above the line of thrust, there is a constant tendency to produce
rotation of the aerodrome, if for any reason its equilibrium is disturbed, which
is corrected in practice by the action of the Pénaud tail. In model No. 6, on
the other hand, the disposition of the three factors was such that they tended
to maintain, rather than to destroy, the initial equilibrium of the machine.</p>

<p>These desirable relative positions had been made possible in model No. 6
by the fact that the center of gravity and line of thrust could be located at
practically any desired point, since with the use of steam the power plant consists
of two separable parts, the boiler, with its fuel and water tanks, and the
engine. These parts can, therefore, be placed in any part of the aerodrome that
constructional or theoretical reasons demand. Furthermore, the engine constitutes
such a relatively small portion of the weight of the entire machine that,
if for any reason it is desirable to place the engine in the same plane as the
line of thrust, its weight is not sufficient to alter materially the position of the
center of gravity, since the boiler, water and fuel tanks can be placed as low
as desirable and connected with the engine by suitable pipes.
<span class="xxpn" id="p210">[p210]</span></p>

<p>With a gasoline engine, however, the conditions are very greatly altered.
Here the engine constitutes practically the entire weight of the power plant,
only such accessories as the ignition coil, batteries, and carburetor being available
for lowering the center of gravity, unless the fuel, cooling water tanks and
radiator be placed below the engine and the liquids forced up by means of a
pump. In making the first designs for the large aerodrome, therefore, it was
found that it would be practically impossible to make the relative positions of
the center of gravity and line of thrust the same as had existed in model No.
6, however desirable it might be. The center of gravity could be brought appreciably
lower than the line of thrust only by placing the gasoline engine in
a plane considerably below that of the propellers, and this necessitated the addition
of at least two more sets of gears with heavy bearings and braces. Besides
this almost prohibitive factor of weight, it was also foreseen that great
difficulty would be experienced in keeping even the two sets of bevel gears already
necessary aligned and in proper condition for efficiently transmitting the
power to the propellers unless the frame and other parts were made prohibitively
heavy. It was, therefore, found necessary to bring the center of gravity practically
in the same plane with the line of thrust, which made its general features
as regards equilibrium more nearly resemble those of model No. 5 than of
No. 6.</p>

<p>The weight of the aviator, it is true, constituted an appreciable part of the
flying weight of the large machine, and it at first seemed possible to lower the
center of gravity by placing him at a considerable distance below the line of
thrust. But it was recognized from the beginning that the aviator would probably
have to give a great deal of attention to any form of engine in order to
insure its working properly, and his position must, therefore, be selected with
a view to the proper supervision of the engine and without regard to its effect
on the center of gravity.</p>

<p>Although the repeated successful flights of model No. 5 under varying conditions
of wind and power inspired the belief that the minor adjustments, as
well as the general plan of the large aerodrome, were such as to give highly
stable equilibrium, nevertheless, more direct corroboration of this opinion was
desired, and it was largely for this reason that the quarter-size model was constructed.
In it every detail of the larger machine which in any way affected its
equilibrium was exactly reproduced to scale, and the greatest care was taken
that the same relative positions of the center of pressure, the center of gravity
and the line of thrust which it was proposed to employ for the large aerodrome
should be used on the model in its flight of August 8, 1903, which is
later described. The entire success of this flight, so far as the balancing was
concerned, in spite of the fact that the engine worked erratically and that the
launching speed was much less than it should have been, removed every doubt <span class="xxpn" id="p211">[p211]</span>
that the equilibrium of the large aerodrome would be satisfactory under normal
conditions.</p>

<p>The second problem encountered in connection with the balancing and control
of the large aerodrome was that of providing an efficient means
for maintaining the equilibrium under varying atmospheric conditions. Although
much had been done toward the solution of this problem in the development
of the models, the whole question was reopened and thoroughly reconsidered
in designing the large aerodrome. The Pénaud tail, when made elastic
or when more or less rigid, but attached to the frame through an elastic
connection, and normally set at a negative angle, furnishes a means of automatically
controlling the equilibrium, which is sufficiently sensitive and accurate
to enable a machine to fly for a considerable distance, at least in moderately
calm weather, as is evidenced by the various flights of the model aerodromes,
where there was no human intelligence to control them. But owing to the principle
of action of the Pénaud tail, the flight of an aerodrome controlled by it
must of necessity be more or less undulatory in its course. Furthermore, the
tests with the models had indicated that, while the Pénaud tail served remarkably
well as a means of controlling the equilibrium of the machine, provided the
balancing had been rather accurately determined, and, further, provided nothing
happened to affect seriously the equilibrium of the machine, it was limited
in its effectiveness by its narrow range of action. It was thought that a control
mechanism which should be more sensitive and at the same time should act
more powerfully to prevent the upsetting of the equilibrium when the machine
was subjected to rather strong disturbing forces was desirable for any machine
which was to transport a human being and, therefore, involved the risk of a
fatal accident.</p>

<p>In the earlier period of the work and before the correct application of the
Pénaud tail to the model aerodromes had been found, Mr. Langley had planned
a large number of different forms of automatic control for preserving the equilibrium
of the machines. The more frequently recurring of these were devices
for changing the angle of the wings or tail, and others for shifting the wings
or tail bodily so as to shift the position of the center of pressure with respect
to the center of gravity, the motive power for operating the devices being in
some cases that derived from a gyroscope or a pendulum, and in others small
electric motor apparatus controlled by a pendulum or a gyroscope. Most of
these, however, never reached the stage of development where they were actually
tried on the machines in flight, as the tests of some of them in the shop
showed that they were unreliable, while others were abandoned either when
partly built or when only the drawings for them had been made. Among the
better-preserved models of devices for this purpose which were in existence
when the writer became associated with the work are those shown in Plate
<a href="#plt068">68</a>, <span class="xxpn" id="p212">[p212]</span>
where the piece at the top is a pendulum (inverted or direct) which controls
the movement of the horizontal tail by means of the cords and apparatus
shown, actuating these through the small electro magnets and apparatus attached.
Just below the rod, which represents a piece of the midrod, are three
parts, the first of which is a group of six little batteries clustered in a circle,
while next to it is a system of needles hung in gymbals, with electro-steering
apparatus in cups which itself turns on a graduated base, these electric connections,
together with the battery, controlling the vertical rudder. On the
right of this is another piece of apparatus for actuating windlass cylinders
which turn one way or the other as the contact is made by one side or the
other of the pendulum or the needle. At the bottom, on the two rods, is a tail-piece
which automatically throws the center of pressure forward or backward
according as the aerodrome departs one way or the other from the horizontal.</p>

<p>In spite of the fact that all the early attempts of Mr. Langley to devise
such a mechanical control had been very unsatisfactory, the idea that something
of this kind was necessary had never really been abandoned by him. Here
was to be seen one of his chief characteristics, which was never to abandon any
idea that seemed valuable until it was brought to a successful issue or some very
strong proof was developed that the idea was impracticable. While on a
trip abroad during the summer of 1899, and especially while resting at Vallombrosa,
Italy, Mr. Langley’s mind again turned to this problem, and he wrote
a number of very interesting letters emphasizing the importance of devising
such a mechanism which should be controlled by gravity. When he returned to
the Institution in the fall he insisted upon the same idea.</p>

PL. 69. MECHANISM OF CONTROL
<a class="linka" href="#listplates">◊</a>
<span class="hhnoshow"><a href="images/plate69e.jpg">lgr</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>A mechanism which had been devised by the writer for another, but somewhat
similar, purpose seemed to be well adapted to this end, and it was accordingly
decided to construct a small model of such a size as would be suitable for
use on one of the steam-driven models. The plan of control which it was proposed
to follow was to have some mechanism which would control the angle of
the tail through the action of gravity on a pendulum bob. Since it would require
an exceedingly heavy pendulum should the deflections of it be directly
utilized to produce corresponding movements of the tail, the most feasible plan
seemed to be to have a light pendulum, which, while free to move under the
action of gravity, would nevertheless by its movement cause some outside force
to produce corresponding and simultaneous movements of the tail. The general
scheme of arrangement is shown in Plate <a href="#plt069">69</a>, Figs. 1 and 2. This device
consists essentially of a cylinder (1) in which is mounted a piston with the
piston rod (3) passing through the cylinder head and connected to the cord (5)
which passes over the pulley (6), fastened to the tube (2), which is slidably
mounted on the midrod (7), whence it is carried
over the pulley (8) on the guy-post
(9). From here it is connected to the spring (10) which
is fastened by the <span class="xxpn" id="p213">[p213]</span>
bridle (11) to the upper side of the Pénaud tail (12). The other end of the piston
rod (3) passes through the head in the other end of the cylinder, and has connected
to it a cord (14) which passes over the pulley (15) fastened to the tube
(2), whence it is continued over the pulley (16) and is joined to the spring (17),
which is connected by the bridle (18) to the lower side of the tail. Mounted
on top of the cylinder (1) is a valve chamber (20) having ports leading to the
two ends of the cylinder. Mounted in the valve chamber is a rocking valve surrounded
by a bushing having ports in it, and to which is fastened a rod (25)
which passes through the said valve and the head of the valve chamber. Fastened
to the rod (25) of the bushing is a lever (26), which by means of the link (27) is
connected to the piston rod (3). Fastened to the rocking valve is a rod (28) which
telescopes over the rod (25) and also passes through the same head of the valve
chamber, and carries at its outer end a pendulum (29) on the lower end of
which is the bob (30).</p>

<p>If steam or any other fluid under pressure is furnished to the valve chamber
through the pipe (31), none will be admitted to the cylinder so long as the
pendulum is vertical or at right angles to the axis of the cylinder; and the tail
will be in its normal position, which we will suppose to be an upward inclination
of five degrees. If, now, the front of the machine be depressed, thereby
causing the pendulum to move to the right, such movement of the pendulum
will cause the valve to open, admitting fluid to the left-hand end of the cylinder.
This, acting on the piston, will force it towards the right, which, by means
of the cord, will cause the angle of the tail to be increased, thereby causing
the rear of the machine to be depressed and the front to be raised. But as
soon as the piston begins to move under the action of the fluid pressure it simultaneously
moves the bushing which surrounds the valve by means of the connecting
links and levers, so that as soon as the piston has moved a distance
proportional to the amount that the valve has been opened by the pendulum,
it causes the bushing to shut off the port and thus prevents further fluid entering
the cylinder. As soon as the aerodrome responds to the action of the
tail the pendulum will, of course, begin to move back to its normal position
of perpendicularity to the cylinder, and will then open the valve to the other
port, thereby causing fluid to pass into the opposite end of the cylinder. This
fluid acting on the piston will move it in the opposite direction and thereby
cause the tail to be drawn back to its normal position at the same time that
the pendulum gradually reaches its normal position, owing to the return of
the aerodrome to its normal position. In the explanation given above it was
assumed that the slidable tube (2) was in a fixed position. It was planned to have
the equilibrium normally maintained automatically and at the same time permit
the operator to modify the automatic control and even to assume full manual
control. To secure this, the slidable tube (2) was connected at each end to an <span class="xxpn" id="p214">[p214]</span>
endless cord (20) which after passing over suitable pulleys was connected
to the control wheel (51) at the aviator’s car.</p>

<p>A model of this device was constructed in the spring of 1900 and was tested
with steam pressure in the shop. The test showed that the device acted immediately
and with precision, the piston performing movements simultaneously and
in exact accordance with the pendulum. The device, however, was never tried
in a flight of any of the aerodromes owing to the lack of time necessary to properly
install it on the machine. Furthermore, it was thought probable that the
rapid acceleration of the aerodrome at the moment of launching would so disturb
the pendulum as to cause it to be in a very different position from that
of vertical, and also that the motion of the aerodrome through the air would
itself be a somewhat disturbing factor.</p>

<p>Because of the difficulties involved in this or any other mechanical device
for controlling the equilibrium, it was in every way advisable to retain in the
large machine the Pénaud system, which, though itself imperfect in many ways,
had been thoroughly tested in actual flight. In the models, it will be remembered,
the combined Pénaud tail and rudder controlled the longitudinal equilibrium
by movement in the vertical plane under the combined influence of its initial
negative angle and the elasticity of its connection with the frame, the flight
being kept as nearly as possible in a straight line by the vertical surfaces of
the tail. Although it was necessary that the large aerodrome should be
capable of being steered in a horizontal direction, it was felt to be unwise to
give the combined Pénaud tail and rudder motion in the horizontal plane in
order to attain this end, since the use of it for such a double function might
very seriously interfere with its proper action in preserving the longitudinal
stability. It was, therefore, at first thought best to dissociate the rudder and
tail so that the rudder might be used for horizontal steering without in any
way interfering with the proper functioning of the tail. But, as the main desideratum
was to obtain a flight of the large machine as soon as possible, and
perfection of steering control seemed secondary, it was decided, after further
consideration, in order not to risk the unpredictable effects that might result
from small changes, to duplicate on the large machine the combined Pénaud
tail and rudder of the model, and to add another rudder for steering in the
horizontal plane. Constructional requirements determined as the only available
position for this rudder a rather disadvantageous one. As will be seen
from Plate <a href="#plt053">53</a>, its efficiency was diminished by its being only about half as far
from the center of gravity as the combined Pénaud tail and rudder, and by
being located in the lee of a considerable portion of the frame, where it would
be subject to the cross-currents of air created by the forward motion of the
frame.
<span class="xxpn" id="p215">[p215]</span></p>

<p>For the preservation of the equilibrium of the aerodrome, though the aviator
might assist by such slight movements as he was able to make in the limited
space of the aviator’s car, the main reliance was upon the Pénaud tail.
But, in the absence of any data for determining the effect produced in passing
from the model to the large machine, it could not be certain that calculations
based upon the balancing of the model would accurately determine the proper
balancing of the large machine. It was therefore decided to provide such attachment
for the Pénaud tail that, while it would always have elastic connection
with the main frame, yet its angle could be appreciably changed without
affecting in any way the degree of elasticity of this connection. After many
changes in plans for securing this result, it was finally decided to arrange it
in the manner shown in the drawings. Referring to the general plans in Plates
<a href="#plt053">53</a> and <a href="#plt054">54</a>, and to the details in
Fig. 1 of Plate <a href="#plt056">56</a>, the main stem of the Pénaud
tail is seen to be connected by a pin to the horn (17), which is brazed to the clamping
thimble, by which it is mounted on the vertical tube (16), suitably connected
and braced to the rear end of the midrod, the horn (17) being larger than the
stem of the tail and set at an angle to the vertical tube (16), the pin connection
permitting the tail to swing up and down. The bridle (40), connected to
the center of the tail on its upper side, passes upward where it is connected
to the spring (41), the other end of which is connected to a single wire rope
(42), which passes over the pulley mounted on the top of the post (43), which
is guyed to the upper guy-post by the wire (44). The wire rope (42), after
passing over the pulley, is connected to the spring (45), around the two ends
of which it forms a loop, and from there it passes down to the plane of the main
frame and through suitable pulley blocks to the aviator’s control wheel (50),
which is mounted on the starboard side of the main frame, convenient to the
aviator’s right hand when he is facing forward. From this point the wire
rope passes through the various pulley blocks towards the rear of the machine,
and through the pulley block (46) mounted on the side and near the bottom of
the rear lower guy-post. At a short distance beyond this pulley it is connected
to a weaker spring (47), the other end of which is connected by a second bridle
(48) to the under side of the Pénaud tail at its center. In order to prevent the
springs (41), (45) and (47), which furnish the elasticity for the Pénaud-tail
connection, from being strained beyond their elastic limit, either by a sudden
gust of wind or by the aviator attempting to move so large an area of surface
too suddenly, the wire rope (42) was made continuous around the springs, the
portion between the points where it was joined to the two ends of the springs
being made of such a length as to take the entire strain should the strain
on the cord become greater than sufficient to stretch the springs 50 per cent of
their original length.
<span class="xxpn" id="p216">[p216]</span></p>

<p>In the construction of the equilibrium control wheel it was decided that
some arrangement must be secured whereby the wheel would normally be inactive
and maintain whatever position it had been set to, and at the same time
could be moved by the aviator with one hand, the mere act of grasping it rendering
it free to be moved, and whereby it must automatically lock itself in
any position in which it might be when the aviator removed his hand from it.
The multiplicity of things requiring the attention of the aviator made it desirable
that his attention to any one of the important details, whether the engine,
the equilibrium, or the steering, should never require more than one hand, thus
leaving the other hand free either to hold on to the machine or to control some
other detail at the same time. While an irreversible wheel, such as would be
secured by the use of a worm and worm-wheel, at first seemed likely to answer
the purpose, yet the movement of a worm-wheel by means of a worm is necessarily
very slow if it is irreversible, and it here seemed desirable to so arrange
the wheel that in case of emergency, of for rising or descending, the aviator
could swing the Pénaud tail from its extreme upper position to its extreme
lower one by a small motion of his hand, and thus small or large adjustments
of the Pénaud tail could be intuitively felt to have been produced without the
aviator having to remember how many turns he had made of the wheel.</p>

<p>The control of the steering rudder was effected by a steering wheel (51)
similar in construction to the equilibrium control wheel (50), a continuous cord
(52) passing from the steering wheel through suitable pulleys to either side of
the steering rudder (<em class="italic-padr">r</em>), springs being interposed in loops in the cord on either
side of the steering rudder to give some elasticity to the control apparatus in
order to prevent possible danger from the aviator attempting to move the rudder
too suddenly. This steering rope passed directly through the steering rudder
at the points where it was joined to it; so that, should one side of the cord
in any way become entangled with the frame or with its pulleys, the strain produced
by the aviator in attempting to move it in the opposite direction would
be taken up by the cord and thereby avoid the possibility of destroying the
rudder. For even should the cord become entangled on one side, the rudder
could be given a slight amount of adjustment through the elasticity of the
coiled springs.</p>

<p>The design of the combined Pénaud tail and rudder followed very closely
that which had been used for the models, and its area of ninety-five square feet
on the horizontal surface with a corresponding area of vertical surface bore
the same relation to the area of the tail and rudder of the models that the area
of the wings of the large machine bore to that of the wings of its prototype.</p>

<p>While the provisions for automatic equilibrium and manual control were
not entirely ideal, even for the quiet atmospheric
conditions under which it <span class="xxpn" id="p217">[p217]</span>
was proposed to make the first tests, nevertheless it was and still is believed
that the provisions for such conditions were sufficient to enable a successful
flight of a few miles to be obtained. It was thought to be very certain that,
once a successful flight could be made, the funds for the further prosecution
of the work would be readily forthcoming, and that when these funds were obtained
the many problems of control, rising and alighting, could be undertaken.</p>

<h3 title="Chapter VIII. The Experimental Engine.">CHAPTER VIII<br />
THE EXPERIMENTAL ENGINE</h3></div>

<p>It will be recalled that the contract for the engine for the large aerodrome,
which had been entered into on December 12, 1898, called for its completion on
February 28, 1899. Between the time when the engine should have been completed
and May, 1900, the engine builder had been engaged in a continuous
series of changes on it, all connected with what might be briefly called its proper
functioning. The actual mechanical construction of the more important parts
had been admirably executed, and this main portion of the constructional work
had been completed within the time called for by the contract. The trouble was
that the engine, which was of the rotary cylinder type, would not furnish anything
like the power which had been expected of it, and which the size and
number of its cylinders indicated that it should furnish. No one who has not
had practical experience in the development of gasoline engines, can understand
or appreciate how fourteen months could be spent in changes in the minor details
of the engine with the expectation that each contemplated change would
bring success; and to anyone who has had experience in the matter, an attempt
to explain the delays would merely seem like a history of his own experiences.
It is, therefore, sufficient to say that the delay on the engine had now reached
a point where it was necessary to bring it to a successful completion immediately
or to abandon it definitely, and either find a competent builder who
had already built engines which, while not necessarily light, were successful,
and who would undertake to construct a light one on the same principles, or, as
a last resort, to turn to steam; and even the contemplation of this was appalling.</p>

<p>On May 6, 1900, the writer went to New York to see what could be done
towards assisting the engine builder to complete the large engine and also, if
possible, the small one which had been ordered for the quarter-size model later
described. He immediately made brake tests of the engine to determine accurately
just what effects were being produced by the different changes the engine
builder was making. Upon the first test the engine was found to develop
only 2.83 horse-power, and this could not be maintained for more than a few
minutes, when without any apparent cause and without any signs of overheating
the engine would altogether cease to develop any power. After remaining
in New York for several weeks, during which time many changes were made
in the engine, he finally got it to the point where it would develop four horse-power
continuously; but, as it seemed impossible to get any better results <span class="xxpn" id="p219">[p219]</span> without
an indefinite amount of experiment, it was decided that all hope of making
this engine an immediate success would have to be abandoned.</p>

<p>Interest in the development of the automobile was increasing at a rapid
rate all over the world, and while the builders in this country had not reached
the stage of development which had been attained in Europe, especially in
France, yet some American builders had succeeded in constructing cars propelled
by gasoline engines which could be depended upon to run at least a short
distance, and it was, therefore, hoped that some one of the more competent of
these builders might be found who would undertake to construct a suitable engine.
After making a most extensive but fruitless search for such a builder in
this country, it was decided that it would be best to see what could be done in
Europe, and as other administrative matters made it necessary for Mr. Langley
to go to Europe about the middle of June, the writer accompanied him to
see what could be done towards having a suitable engine built there. Some six
weeks were spent in visiting all the important builders of gasoline engines in
Europe, and the results were very discouraging. Everywhere the builders said
that they did not care to undertake the work, and that they did not consider
it possible to construct an engine of 12 horse-power weighing less than 100 to
150 kilograms (220 to 330 lbs.), or that, if they had thought it possible, they
would already have built it, as they had had numerous inquiries for such engines,
and also wanted them for their own use. The last hope of securing a
suitable gasoline engine seemed to have vanished.</p>

<p>But, discouraging as was the refusal of the engine builders of Europe to
undertake to build the engine, and still more so their opinion that such an engine
was an impossibility, inspection of the engines exhibited at the Paris Exposition
had so strengthened the writer’s conviction of the possibility of the
undertaking that, before parting with Mr. Langley on August 3 to return to
America, he personally assumed the responsibility of building an engine which
would meet the requirements.</p>

<p>Upon returning from Europe on August 13, and finding that the engine
builder in New York had made no progress whatever towards improving the
engine during his absence, the writer condemned both the large engine and the
small one. The engine builder had practically bankrupted himself in his attempts
to construct these two engines, having spent something like $8000 or
$10,000 in actual wages over and above the contract prices for the engines, to
say nothing of remuneration for his own time or such expenses as shop rent
and power. As all of the money for the large machine and practically all for
the small one had been advanced to him at various times to assist him over
financial stringencies—such advances, however, having been secured by suitable
bonds—it was decided to take the various parts of the two engines in <span class="xxpn" id="p220">[p220]</span>
payment for the money which had been advanced, as it was hoped that some
of the parts of the engines might prove of use in experimental work.</p>

<p>Immediately after the writer’s return to Washington he began work on the
development of an engine. Taking some of the parts of the engine which had
been condemned and constructing others, he was able by September 18 to have
an experimental engine at work which, while not water-jacketed, but provisionally
cooled by wrapping wet cloths around the cylinders, developed
<span class="mixfract">18<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">2</span></span></span>
horse-power
on the Prony brake at 715 R. P. M., the engine, including these wet
cloths, weighing 108 pounds. Of course these wet cloths sufficed to keep the
engine cool for only a short time—three to four minutes being the maximum.
This was only a temporary expedient for enabling the engine to run for a sufficient
time to make brake tests and determine the power it developed, but the
results obtained were so very encouraging that it was decided to make water
jackets for the cylinders of this engine and see what power it would then develop
for more extended periods.</p>

<p>This experimental engine, which was merely a “patched-up” affair, was
first equipped with a sparking arrangement built on the wiping-contact principle.
With this sparking arrangement several important difficulties presented
themselves, among which may be particularly mentioned the great difficulty of
so adjusting the sparking arrangements that the explosion in each cylinder occurred
at exactly the same point in its cycle that the explosions occurred in all
the other cylinders, it being necessary to secure this result to a reasonably
accurate degree in order to cause the engine to run smoothly enough to be
used in the aerodrome. Where an engine has a large and heavy fly-wheel running
at a high rate of speed, the nicety of adjustment of the sparking arrangement
is not so essential, for the fly-wheel acts as a reservoir of energy and
tends to smooth out the rough and jerky impulses which would be otherwise
introduced by slight variations in the force of the explosions in the cylinders.
In constructing an engine for an aerodrome, however, the permissible weight
of the engine is so very small that the use of a fly-wheel having sufficient
weight to act as an energy reservoir is practically prohibited. Another serious
difficulty which was encountered with the wiping-contact type of sparking
arrangement was that of keeping the stuffing boxes around the rotating contact
rods tight enough to prevent leakage, without at the same time binding
and causing excessive friction. Although it seemed probable that the difficulties
which have been mentioned, and other minor ones which were apparent,
could be remedied by further experiment, yet the high tension or “jump-spark”
type of sparking apparatus seemed to offer much greater advantages. Since
it had fewer moving parts, and furthermore since the wiping-contact sparking arrangement
would have to be considerably modified in order to permit the construction
of water jackets around the cylinders, it was decided to construct a <span class="xxpn" id="p221">[p221]</span>
new sparking arrangement for the engine on the jump-spark principle. After
introducing this change in the engine it was found to run very much more
smoothly and to require a minimum amount of care in adjusting it.</p>

<p>At the time that this engine was being developed it was practically impossible
to obtain any outside information regarding the proper way of constructing
it. The little that was then known had been learned through laborious
experience and at great cost by the experimenters who were attempting to
build automobiles, and was zealously guarded in the hope of preventing their
rivals from utilizing the results of their labors. It was the known custom,
however, of all engine builders at this time to use a separate spark coil and a
separate contact maker for each cylinder of an engine, no matter how many
cylinders there were. This multiplication of the spark coils, which at that time
were very heavy, not only added greatly to the weight but also had the same defect
that the wipe-spark type of sparking arrangement had of being exceedingly
difficult to so adjust that all of the contact makers would perform their
functions at exactly the same point in the cycle for each cylinder. To obviate
these difficulties, both of adjustment and of excessive weight, the writer devised
what is supposed to have been at that time a new and valuable multiple-sparking
arrangement whereby only one battery, one coil and one contact maker were
utilized for causing the spark in all five cylinders, a small commutating arrangement
in the high-tension circuit distributing the sparks to the proper cylinders
at the proper time. This form of sparking arrangement was found upon
test to work so satisfactorily that it was afterwards adopted for the small engine
of the quarter-size model, and also for the new and larger engine which
was afterwards built and which will be described further on. It is needless
to describe in detail the many and perplexing difficulties which were experienced
in procuring suitable spark coils, spark plugs and other appurtenances of the
sparking apparatus, all of which at this time were in a very crude state of
development, there being only a few different makes on the market, and most
of these being very unsatisfactory. One important minor improvement connected
with the spark plugs may be described, as the beneficial effect produced
by it was so very great that its use was continued in all future spark plugs for
all of the engines. This improvement, however, is now incorporated in many
of the plugs which are on the market, and in some cases patents, covering the
particular form in which the improvement is incorporated, are exploited by the
manufacturer. Considerable difficulty was at first experienced with the spark
plugs from a coating of soot (resulting from the incomplete combustion of the
gas and oil in the cylinder at the time of explosion) which formed on the porcelain
and thereby caused a short-circuit, preventing the plug from working
properly. This was overcome by extending the metal portion of the plug for
some distance into the cylinder, and for something like three-quarters of an <span class="xxpn" id="p222">[p222]</span>
inch beyond the end of the porcelain insulator. The terminal which passed
through the insulator was also extended for something like half an inch beyond
the porcelain and bent to a proper extent to co-act with a piece of platinum
wire inserted in the interior wall of the plug which formed the other terminal.
After making this improvement in the plugs practically no difficulty was experienced
from short-circuits caused by the soot.</p>

<p>In making the tests of this experimental engine it was found practically
impossible to absorb the power by a Prony brake in a sufficiently uniform manner
on account of the fact that the engine was being run without a fly wheel.
The consequent variation in the torque and speed during each revolution caused
such great fluctuations in the reading of the scales which measured the pull of
the Prony brake that no confidence could be felt in the accuracy of the readings
and, therefore, no confidence could be placed in the determinations of the effect
which different changes in the engine produced. A water-absorption dynamometer
consisting of a number of flat, circular discs fastened to a shaft and rotating
between other parallel flat discs arranged in a circular drum which was
filled to any desired extent with water was immediately planned, and the construction
of two of them was begun so that power could be taken from both
ends of the engine shaft, which, on account of its necessary lightness, was
apt to be injured by being twisted when all the power was taken from one
end of the shaft. In order to continue the tests on the engine while this
dynamometer was being made it was decided to employ one of the propellers
as a dynamometer. Although no accurate tests had been made to determine
just how much power was required to drive these propellers at various speeds,
yet the fundamental law was known that under the same conditions the power
required to drive any propeller would vary as the cube of the number of revolutions,
and since the Prony-brake tests had given an approximation as to the
amount of power which the engine developed at certain speeds, the law of the
propeller, and extrapolations from the data obtained in the tests of the smaller
propellers in 1898, enabled further approximations to be made as to the amount
of extra power which the engine developed when certain changes enabled it to
drive the propeller at increased speeds. This method had also the great advantage
that, since the power required varies as the cube of the number of
revolutions, it is practically impossible for the engine to “run away” with the
propeller and cause serious damage through the possible excessive strains introduced
by high speed. This feature is also possessed by water-absorption
dynamometers of the type which were built and used in the later tests.</p>

<p>The construction of water jackets for this engine proved an exceedingly
formidable task, it being impossible to braze the jackets directly to the walls
of the cylinders without risk of ruining them. It therefore became necessary
to attach them by means of stuffing boxes, which,
on account of their large size <span class="xxpn" id="p223">[p223]</span>
and the necessity for keeping the weight a minimum, was a most difficult piece
of work. The work was rendered still more difficult by the fact that the water
jackets had to be made in halves which were brazed together after they had
been fitted over the head of the cylinder. Even when the work was done in
the most careful way this method of construction gave a great deal of trouble
from the leaking of the stuffing boxes or the jackets themselves. However,
after much delay, the water jackets were finally completed, and upon test the
engine was found to develop 21.5 horse-power at 825 R. P. M., the engine itself
weighing 120 pounds.</p>

<p>Further changes were made in this engine, especially in the pistons, a new
set of which were constructed which weighed 15 pounds less than the original
set. On account of the difficulty with the leakage of the water around the
stuffing boxes of the water jackets, and also from imperfections in the brazed
joints of the jackets themselves, it was found impossible to rely on the power
that the engine would develop at any particular time, as the water leaking
from the jackets and running down on the spark plugs of the lower cylinders
caused these cylinders to work erratically, and this not only materially reduced
the power but also caused jerky impulses in the absence of fly wheels.</p>

<p>It seemed so desirable to obtain as soon as possible a first test in actual
flight of the large machine that the writer offered to put this engine in the
aerodrome frame and make a test with it if the machine were launched over
the water, but with the launching track mounted directly on the river bank.
However, Mr. Langley felt it so necessary to make the initial test from the
top of the house-boat and at an elevation of 30 feet or more that he would not
consent to this, and as the engine at its best did not develop quite 24 horse-power,
which had been calculated as the minimum which should be provided,
it was thought unwise to attempt to make the first test from the top of the
house-boat until the aerodrome had been provided with engines that could be
depended on to develop continuously not less than 24 horse-power.</p>

<p>It then became necessary either to build a duplicate engine and use both
of them in the aerodrome, the original plan as already explained having been
to have two engines developing the 24 horse-power together; or, second, to construct
an entirely new engine large enough to furnish a minimum of 24 horse-power
and use this single engine.</p>

<p>As the construction and tests of this experimental engine had shown many
places in which the weight might be safely reduced, the writer decided to construct
an entirely new and larger single engine, and thereby avoid the extra
weight and difficulties which would be introduced by having to use synchronizing
gears where two engines were used, it being impossible, of course, to run
the two propellers from the two engines independently without risk of serious
disaster.
<span class="xxpn" id="p224">[p224]</span></p>

<p>It will be recalled that when the aerodrome was originally planned in 1898
it was proposed to have two engines of 12 horse-power each, and the contract
for the single engine of 12 horse-power provided that a duplicate was to be
supplied, if desired, immediately upon the completion and delivery of the first
one. The calculations, both from the whirling-table tests and from the results
with the steam-driven models in actual flight, indicated that 24 horse-power
would be ample for the aerodrome, which it was then expected would not exceed
640 pounds in weight, with a supporting surface of 960 square feet. But
it was found that the total weight of the machine was rapidly increasing on
account of slight increases in the various details, which when added together
made a considerable increase in weight. Furthermore, as it had been found
difficult to keep all five of the cylinders of the experimental engine working
uniformly, it was thought best to build this new engine sufficiently large to provide
not only the extra power necessary because of the increased weight of the
aerodrome, but also to provide for further inevitable increases in weight, and
over and above all this, to provide also that the engine would furnish all the
power necessary, even though one of its cylinders should absolutely fail to work
and act as a dead load on the others. The writer accordingly designed this new
engine to give 40 horse-power when all five of the cylinders were working, and
28 horse-power even though one cylinder should act as a dead load on the others.</p>

<p>The various materials for the construction of this engine were ordered early
in December, 1900, with the promise of delivery not later than January, 1901.
Owing to various causes, however, the major portion of the materials could
not be obtained until late in the spring, and, in fact, a portion of them were
not obtained until the summer of 1901. During this period of delay, however,
the engine for the quarter-size model was completely reconstructed and further
tests were made with the experimental engine in developing accessories, such
as carburetors and spark coils.</p>

<p>The float-feed type of carburetor which was then coming into prominence
in automobile work proved at that stage of its development to be totally unsuitable,
as the slight but constant tremor of the aerodrome frame, when the
engine was working at high speeds under a heavy load, caused the float to act
as a pump and periodically flood the carburetor. This resulted in an irregularity
of action of the engine which at times injured not only the transmission
shafts, gears, and frame, but the engine itself by the serious pounding which
occurred. A form was next tried in which the gasoline was fed in through the
valve seat of a lightly loaded valve which raised whenever there was suction in
the inlet pipe, the amount of gasoline fed being regulated by a pin valve. Later
there were built several shapes and sizes of tanks filled with absorbent material,
which was saturated with gasoline and the surplus drawn off before starting
the engine. Some of these tanks were provided with a jacket through which <span class="xxpn" id="p225">[p225]</span>
a portion of the exhaust gases was passed in order to compensate for the cooling
of the tank caused by the evaporation of the gasoline. As a result of these
tests it was found that a type consisting essentially of a tank filled with small
lumps of a porous cellular wood (tupelo wood) which was initially saturated
with gasoline, and into which the gasoline was fed through a distributing pipe
as rapidly as it was taken up by the air, which was sucked through it by the
engine, gave the best results. Instead of jacketing this tank, the cooling effect
due to evaporation was compensated by drawing the somewhat heated air from
around the engine cylinders up through the loosely packed lumps of wood. When
tested in the shop this type was found to give such a very uniform mixture
that the engine ran as smoothly and regularly as an electric motor, the vibration
in no way interfering with it, and even when the sudden change from a
state of rest to one of rapid motion through the air was imitated by suddenly
turning on the carburetor the blast of several large electric fans from various
angles, it was found to have no appreciable effect on the running of the engine,
thus indicating that the trouble which was experienced with the model
aerodrome in the trials of 1901 was not likely to be repeated with the large
aerodrome. Somewhat more than a dozen carburetors of various forms were
constructed before this last type was devised, but this proved so satisfactory
that there were never thereafter any carburetor troubles. In fact, as will later
appear, a carburetor of this type kept the engine on the large aerodrome running
at full power not only when the aerodrome was in a vertical position in
the air, but also after it had turned completely over on its back.</p>

<h3 title="Chapter IX.
The Quarter-size Model Aerodrome.">CHAPTER IX<br />
THE QUARTER-SIZE MODEL AERODROME</h3></div>

<p>Owing to the very considerable changes which constructional reasons necessitated
in the relative positions of the center of pressure, center of gravity,
and line of thrust from those which theoretical considerations pointed to as being
best, it was decided in January, 1900, to build a one-quarter-size model of
the large aerodrome, if a suitable engine capable of furnishing something like
one and a half horse-power could be procured without delay. It was hoped
that it might be possible to construct this model immediately without seriously
interfering with the progress of the work on the large machine, and that some
tests in free flight could then be made with it, which would give very much
more reliable data from which to determine the balancing of the large aerodrome
than had been obtained from the tests of the steam-driven models Nos.
5 and 6. A factor of uncertainty would still remain, due to the difference in
size between the large machine and the model, which could be determined only
by actual trial of the large machine itself; but by making the model an exact
duplicate, on a smaller scale of the large machine, very valuable results could
be obtained. Tests of it in free flight would involve, even with the probable
attendant breakages, a comparatively small expenditure of time and money.
A search was immediately begun for an engine builder who would undertake
to furnish a suitable engine for this model. The specifications called for an engine
developing one and a half horse-power on the Prony brake for five minutes
without diminution in power caused by over heating. While it was desired
if possible to get an engine which would come within the given weight and develop
the required power for a longer time than five minutes, it was foreseen
that the construction of a multiple-cylinder engine of so small a power
made it necessary to resort to the air-cooled type, and that such an engine would be
doing exceedingly well to develop its maximum power continuously for as much
as five minutes. The only engine builder who could be found willing to undertake
the construction of such an engine was the one already engaged in the
construction of the larger engine. As this builder was already twelve months
behind in the delivery of the large engine, it was felt that it would be unwise
to give it to him, both because the work on it might still further delay him in
the completion of the large one, and also because he was still having troubles
with the large one, which it was not certain he would ever be able to overcome.
After further consideration of the matter, however, it seemed so important to have
a model which was an exact duplicate of the large machine for the <span class="xxpn" id="p227">[p227]</span> making
of tests, which might prevent not only serious damage but possibly fatal
accidents, that upon the assurance of the engine builder that the undertaking
of the small engine would in no way interfere with the completion of the large
one, a contract was entered into on February 23, 1900, which specified that the
engine should be delivered by April 1, with a penalty for any delay beyond
that date.</p>

<p>The frame for this quarter-size model was immediately begun and extra
workmen were employed for work on it in order that its construction should
in no way delay the completion of the large machine. The decision to construct
this quarter-size model of the large aerodrome had been made on the assumption
that, since it was to be one-sixteenth the weight of the large machine, and
therefore much heavier in comparison to its size than the steam models Nos.
5 and 6, it would, therefore, not need to be so carefully constructed in order to
obtain sufficient strength. But when construction was actually begun it was
found not only that the simpler and less expensive methods which it had been
proposed to use in joining its frame together resulted in a weak construction,
but also that the time consumed in tinkering up the imperfections in the joints
more than counterbalanced the extra time which would have been required to
make the joints in the best manner from the beginning. Before going very far
it was therefore decided to make the joints by following the same process which
had been developed in the construction of the previous models. The frame was
accordingly built in the most substantial manner, and when guyed by a system
of guy-wires similar to that employed for the large machine it was found to
be exceedingly stiff, in fact very much stronger and stiffer than the frame of
any of the preceding models.</p>

<p>In originally planning the model the intention was to make all its linear
dimensions exactly one-fourth those of the large aerodrome. Before the designs
were completed, however, it was seen from the previous experience with
the steam-driven models that instead of the 62.5-cm. propellers, which a strict
adherence to the quarter-size plan would demand, it would be necessary to use
propellers which were at least one metre in diameter. Moreover, as the small
engine would be more than one-fourth the size of the engine under construction
for the large aerodrome, a departure from the scale in the case of the
transverse frame would be necessary. The designs were therefore altered so
as to admit of using the larger propellers, and the tubes which formed the front
of the transverse frame were bent, as shown in the plan photograph, Plate <a href="#plt070">70</a>,
in order to give a large enough space for properly mounting the engine.</p>

<p>The frame with these modifications was completed in June, 1900, but no
engine was ready for it, as the builder had failed to fulfill his contract for either
the large or the small engine, although several trips to New York had been
made to expedite their successful completion.
<span class="xxpn" id="p228">[p228]</span></p>

<p>Soon after this it became certain that the engines for both aerodromes
would have to be constructed in the shops of the Institution, and owing to the
greater importance of the experimental engine for the large aerodrome, all the
facilities of the shops were devoted to the early completion of it. In November,
1900, however, it was seen that the experimental engine alone would not
furnish sufficient power for the large aerodrome, and that a duplicate of it
would have to be built or a new and larger engine designed and constructed,
and that therefore it would be impossible to get the first tests of the large aerodrome
in free flight before the following summer. It was therefore decided
that it would be best to suspend work temporarily on the large aerodrome and
its engine, and put all the workmen who could possibly be employed on the construction
of the small engine, so that it would be ready in time to permit some
tests of the quarter-size model to be made during the following spring.</p>

<p>In order to expedite its construction as much as possible, the attempt was
made to utilize all the available parts from the small engine which had been
undertaken by the engine builder in New York. The cylinders, which it had
been expected would be kept cool by their rotation around the crank pin, were
not well adapted for use as stationary cylinders, since they were not provided
with radiating ribs, but it was hoped that by using them an engine could be very
quickly constructed which would keep cool long enough to enable some short
flights to be made with the model.</p>

<p>The work on this small engine was pushed forward very rapidly, so that
within a short time it was sufficiently complete to allow some power tests to be
made with it. In the first of these tests the attempt was made to measure the
power by means of the Prony brake, but as the engine had no fly wheel the
fluctuations in speed during each revolution were so great as to make it impossible
to obtain readings of any value. When it was attempted to remedy
this by putting a fly wheel on either side of the crank shaft of the engine, it was
found that the sudden starting of the engine caused such severe strains in the
crank shaft, which had been built strong enough for driving the propellers but
not for suddenly starting fly wheels having considerable inertia, as to make it
unsafe to continue the use of fly wheels. As without them the Prony brake could
not be used, it was decided to build a small water-absorption dynamometer on
the same principle as the larger ones which were under construction for the large
engine. As this larger dynamometer has already been described, it is only necessary
to add that the small one consisted of twelve rotating plates and twelve
stator plates twelve inches in diameter. In order to avoid the construction of
a special and elaborate testing frame for mounting the engine and the dynamometer
exactly in line with each other, it was attempted to connect them by
means of a universal joint. This “short cut” also proved the “long way
around.” The strains set up in the universal joint by
the sudden starting of <span class="xxpn" id="p229">[p229]</span>
the engine caused so much trouble on account of the inertia of the rotating
plates of the dynamometer that the time lost in keeping the universal joint in
working order during the tests more than counterbalanced the extra time which
would have been required to construct a special wooden frame on which the
dynamometer and engine could have been mounted in line with each other so
that the crank shaft of the engine could have been directly connected to the
shaft of the dynamometer.</p>

<p>Much time was also lost in the effort to construct an apparatus by which
a record could be obtained of the power actually used in propelling the aerodrome.
Various methods were in use by which the thrust of the propellers
could be more or less satisfactorily measured while the aerodrome was at rest,
but it was desired to know just how much power the aerodrome consumed while
in actual free flight. Such a record it was hoped to obtain from a device incorporated
in the propeller shafts. This thrust-measuring device consisted essentially
of a propeller shaft made in two sections, one section telescoping the
other for a short distance. On the section of the shaft to which the propeller
was attached there was mounted a drum, having in its circumference two long
slots diametrically opposite. To the other section of the shaft a disc was fastened
with two diametrically opposite rollers mounted on its periphery, which
fitted the slots in the drum of the other section. A compression spring was interposed
between the disc and the drum, and the outside of the drum was so arranged
that a strip of paper could be wound around and fastened to it which would serve
as a chronograph sheet. A pencil was fastened to the frame, and, since the drum
was connected to the section of the shaft to which the propeller was attached and
which therefore moved to and from the frame under the action of the propeller
thrust, a record of the actual thrust of the propeller at any particular moment
could be obtained by simply pressing the pencil up against the paper on the drum
and calculating the thrust from the calibration of the compression spring. Since
the thrust would naturally be greater when the propellers were revolving in
a moored condition, during the few moments after the engine was started up
and before the aerodrome was launched, it was necessary to provide means for
having the pencil point held away from the chronograph sheet until the aerodrome
was launched, and then have the point come to bear on the sheet. This
was accomplished by having the point held off by a small trigger arrangement
which was to be released just at the moment that the aerodrome left the launching
car. A set of propeller shafts embodying this thrust-recording device was
constructed, but when they were actually tested on the aerodrome many difficulties
were encountered which had not been anticipated. In the first place
the gasoline engine for the model was started up (or “cranked over”) by
turning the propellers by hand. A gasoline engine never starts slowly, and on
account of this suddenness of starting causes a very great strain in any <span class="xxpn" id="p230">[p230]</span>
shafting
by which it is connected to any driven mechanism. The inertia of the driven
mechanism, even though it be apparently small, becomes a most serious matter
when an attempt is made to start up very suddenly. This effect is very much
intensified if the driven mechanism is connected to the engine through even one
pair of gears, for there is always a certain amount of back-lash between the
teeth of the gears, and the effect of this back-lash is still further intensified
when the driven mechanism is turned over by hand in order to start the engine,
as this takes up the back-lash on one side of the gears, and the moment the engine
starts permits a free movement until it suddenly takes up the back-lash
and strikes the other side of the gear teeth with a blow. The effect of this
sudden starting of the engine proved most disastrous to the thrust-recording
devices, and, although they were considerably strengthened, it was found after
a short time that in order to make them strong enough to withstand the shock
of the sudden starting of the engine it would be necessary to make them inordinately
heavy. It was therefore decided to abandon all attempts to incorporate
the thrust-recording device on this quarter-size model, but it was hoped
to install it later on one of the steam-driven models, where the engine starts so
slowly that there would be no need for excessive strength in it.</p>

<p>The engine for the quarter model when reconstructed with stationary instead
of rotating cylinders was found in the shop tests referred to above to
develop when working at its best between
<span class="mixfract">1<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">2</span></span></span>
and 2 horse-power, as measured
by the absorption dynamometers. However, it was impossible to maintain this
power steadily for more than 30 seconds. In the first place, the same difficulties
(heretofore described) that were met with in securing a suitable carburetor for
the experimental engine were experienced at the same time in the development
of the small engine. In the second place, as the engine had no cooling apparatus
of any kind, it was found that it could not be tested in the shop for more than
30 seconds owing to premature explosions. It was hoped, however, that by having
everything ready for a flight before starting the engine, it might be possible
to launch the aerodrome before the cylinders began to heat seriously,
and that the greatly increased cooling effect due to the motion of the aerodrome
through the air would permit the engine to develop sufficient power to secure a
flight that would show whether or not the balancing was correct, as the final
disposition of some of the accessories on the large aerodrome could not be so
well settled until it was known just how the calculated balancing of this new
model corresponded with the actual balancing necessary for flight.</p>

<p>On account of Mr. Langley’s reliance on the generally sound theory that
where a successful method of conducting an experiment has been found only
after a long series of failures it is best not to change to some unknown and
untried plan, it was impossible, especially where failure in the test might involve
a fatal accident, to get him to deviate from his original plan of <span class="xxpn" id="p231">[p231]</span>
launching
the large aerodrome from the top of the house-boat. He apparently realized
as well as anyone, that in many respects the making of the test from
the top of the house-boat had many serious drawbacks, but he emphasized and
impressed on the writer the importance of following as far as possible in the
construction and test of the large machine, the plans which had brought success
with the models. Believing, however, that there was probably a better
method of launching the aerodrome than from the top of the house-boat, and
that it would be well to prepare before hand as far as possible for following
some other plan of launching immediately after a first successful test had been
obtained from the top of the boat, Mr. Langley had constructed some floats
which were arranged to be attached to the launching car of the quarter-size
model so that the car could be converted into a catamaran raft. It was not believed
that this crude arrangement would suffice for a complete launching apparatus,
since the power of the aerodrome propellers would not be great enough
to force the raft through the water at a sufficiently high speed; still it was
thought that by having the launching car arranged in this way the model might
be allowed to drive the raft rapidly through the water and thus give some idea
as to what would be necessary, in a more complete launching apparatus, to obviate
the danger of the drag of the raft causing the model to plunge over headlong
into the water. The launching car with these floats attached to it, and
with the quarter-size model mounted on the car, is clearly shown in Plates <a href="#plt073">73</a>
and <a href="#plt074">74</a>.</p>

<p>While the results obtained with superposed wings in the tests of models
Nos. 5 and 6 in the summer of 1899 indicated that the “single-tier” surfaces
were much more efficient, still, as has been already stated, the great advantages
of the superposed surfaces, so far as strength of construction is concerned, was
fully realized at all times. As a result of these tests it was decided to use
the “single-tier” surfaces in the first test of the large machine in order to insure
as far as possible the best conditions. However, it was from the beginning
planned to construct superposed surfaces for use in the later tests of
the large machine; and, in order to obtain more reliable data on such surfaces
than had been obtained in the tests of the models in the summer of 1899, a
set of superposed surfaces for the quarter-size model were constructed during
the winter of 1900–1901. The quarter-size model, equipped with these surfaces,
is shown in Plates <a href="#plt075">75</a> and <a href="#plt076">76</a>,
where the model is seen mounted on its launching
car, which is attached to the floats heretofore referred to. It was originally
planned not to employ guy-posts when using the superposed surfaces, but after
the latter had been constructed and attached to the frame, it was found that
they would have to be made with rigid joints instead of hinged joints if the
guy-posts were omitted. As the hinged joints, however, were already made,
and permitted the surfaces to be folded up so as to occupy a much smaller
<span class="xxpn" id="p232">[p232]</span>
space in shipping them, it was decided to retain the hinged form of construction
and use the guy-posts as shown in the above plates.</p>

CYLINDERS OF ENGINE OF QUARTER-SIZE MODEL AERODROME
<a class="linka" href="#listplates">◊</a></div>
</div>

<p>After much delay, due to various causes, the quarter-size model, as shown
in plan, end elevation, side elevation and three-quarter elevation in Plates <a href="#plt071">71</a>
and <a href="#plt072">72</a>, respectively, was taken down the river in June, 1901, in order to make
some tests with it from the small house-boat, which had been previously moved
to the middle of the river opposite Widewater, Va. A test of it in free flight
was made on June 18, its condition at this time being shown by Data Sheet No.
12 in Appendix. The launching apparatus worked perfectly and the aerodrome
started off on an absolutely even keel, dropping only a few inches immediately
upon leaving the launching apparatus, and continuing straight ahead directly
into the light wind of something less than 2 miles an hour. After it had gone
only about 100 feet, however, it began to descend slowly, but still maintained a
perfectly even balance, and finally touched the water about 150 feet from the
house-boat, having been in the air between 4 and 5 seconds. It was immediately
recovered, and as soon as the wings could be dried out another test was
made, as it was thought probable that the wind had interfered with the carburetor
to such an extent that the engine had not received the proper mixture
of gas. Upon this second test the launching apparatus again worked perfectly
and the aerodrome again flew straight ahead on a perfectly even keel, and at a
uniform height from the water until it had gone about 300 feet, when it again
began to descend slowly and finally touched the water about 350 feet from the
house-boat, having been in the air about 10 seconds. While the tests were very
disappointing, owing to the extreme brevity of the flights, yet they showed conclusively
that the balancing of the aerodrome was correct, at least as far as
motion in a straight line and in a quiet atmosphere was concerned. As one
and a half horse-power, which was felt to be the very minimum which would
successfully propel the aerodrome, was furnished by the engine only when working
at its very best, and as the change in conditions from a quiet state to a
velocity of something like 40 feet per second evidently caused a considerable
drop in the power because of the change in the gaseous mixture which the carburetor
furnished to the engine, it was decided not to make any further test of
the aerodrome until the engine cylinders could be reconstructed so as to provide
more effective means for cooling it, and thereby a reasonable margin of
power above that actually necessary. The aerodrome was accordingly returned
to Washington for the purpose of making new cylinders for the engine. In
constructing these new cylinders the old cylinder heads from the previous cylinders
were used in order to expedite their completion. This proved in the
end to be a very great mistake, though at the time it seemed probable that the
use of them would save much delay and considerable expense. The new cylinders
were constructed of steel tubing originally one-half inch thick, which <span class="xxpn" id="p233">[p233]</span>
was machined to the form clearly shown in the photograph, Plate <a href="#plt077">77</a>, where it
will be seen that thin radiating ribs spaced one-quarter inch apart were formed
integral with the cylinder, the combustion chambers or heads being screwed on
and brazed to the cylinders. After much delay the new cylinders were completed,
and upon test it was found that while the radiating ribs assisted very
greatly in keeping the engine cool, yet the valves were so small that the gas
was not able to get in and out of the cylinders rapidly enough to permit the
engine to furnish its full power. Even at this stage it would have been better
either to have made new cylinder heads with larger valves or to have made
entirely new cylinders and cylinder heads, but in the effort to economize time
and money it seemed best to try to overcome part of the defect by adding an
auxiliary inlet valve. This was constructed, and upon test it was found that,
although the engine developed 3.2 horse-power on the Prony brake at 1800
R. P. M., and even maintained 5.1 horse-power on the brake for a few seconds
when running at 3000 R. P. M., the ports leading from the valve chamber to the
cylinders were so small that they became heated after the engine had run for
2 minutes and premature ignition occurred, which, of course, immediately and
very greatly reduced the power developed.</p>

<p>It was decided, however, in view of the tests in which the engine had developed
3.2 horse-power at 1800 R. P. M., that there was sufficient margin of
power to enable it to propel the quarter-size model, even if it was not working
at its best. After concluding the Prony-brake tests on the engine, it was
mounted in its proper position in the aerodrome frame and connected to the propeller
shafts. Some pendulum tests were then made, showing an average lift
of approximately 57 per cent of the total flying weight. But it was found that
the propeller and transmission shafts and their bearings would not stand the
strain due to the increased power of the engine. Newer and stronger shafts
and bearings were, therefore, constructed and further pendulum tests were
made. It was then found that the transverse frame which supported the shafts
and bearings was too weak, and this was strengthened by substituting newer and
thicker tubing where it seemed necessary.</p>

<p>These changes and repairs were all completed by October, 1901, and the
quarter-size model was at last, after months of delay, felt to be in a condition
which justified the expectation that its next flight would be entirely successful.
In view of the much more important work on the large aerodrome which demanded
immediate attention the quarter-size model in this completed condition
was put aside. Nothing more was done with it until April, 1903, when some
shop tests were made preliminary to taking it to Quantico, where, on August
8, it made a successful flight, which is described in Chapter XII <a href="#tocontents">◊</a>.</p>

<h3 title="Chapter X.
Construction and Tests of the Large Engine.">CHAPTER X<br />
CONSTRUCTION AND TESTS OF THE LARGE ENGINE</h3></div>

<p>The main requirement in an engine for an aerodrome—aside from reliability
and smoothness of operation, which are necessary in an engine for any
kind of locomotion—is that it shall develop the greatest amount of power for
the least weight. It is, therefore, desirable to reduce the weight and number
of parts of the engine to the very minimum, so far as this can be done without
sacrificing reliability and smoothness of running. Furthermore, since the
strongest metal for its weight is steel, and since the greatest strength of steel
is utilized when the stress acting on it is one of tension, it is advisable to design
the engine so that the parts which sustain the greatest strains shall be
of steel and, as far as possible, meet with strains which are purely tensional
ones.</p>

<p>In designing the new engine for the large aerodrome it was, therefore,
planned to make it entirely of steel, as far as this was possible. The only
parts which were not of steel were the bronze bushings for the bearings, the
cast-iron pistons, and cast-iron liners of the cylinders. Previous experience had
shown that, while it is possible to use a cast-iron piston in a steel cylinder or
even a steel piston in a steel cylinder, provided the lubrication be kept exactly
adjusted, yet the proper lubrication of the piston and cylinder of a gas engine
is difficult even under the most favorable conditions, owing to the fact that excessive
lubrication causes trouble from the surplus oil interfering with the sparking
apparatus. It was, therefore, determined not to risk serious trouble by attempting
to have the pistons bear directly on the steel walls of the cylinders.</p>

<p>While visiting the French engine builders in the summer of 1900 in the attempt
to find one willing to undertake the construction of a suitable engine for
the aerodrome, it was pointed out to them that the great amount of weight
which they claimed to be necessary for the cylinders, and which they stated
made it impossible for them to build an engine which would meet the requirements
as to power and weight, could be very greatly reduced by making the
cylinders in the form of thin steel shells having cast-iron linings. All, however,
to whom this suggestion was made declared that it was impossible to build
satisfactory cylinders in this way; some of them even stated that they had tried
it and found it impossible to keep the thin liners tight in the steel shells. The
difficulty which they had encountered is due to the difference in expansion of
the steel and the iron when raised to a rather high temperature by the heat of
the explosions, if the cylinders are not well jacketed
with water; and if the steel <span class="xxpn" id="p235">[p235]</span>
shells are water jacketed they then do not expand as much as the cast-iron
liners, and this causes the latter to become “out of round” because of the
compression strains produced in them when trying to expand more than the
steel shells. As past experience had shown, however, that it was possible to
keep the liners tight in small cylinders, it was believed that by taking proper
care in the construction there would be no difficulty in this respect with the
cylinders of this larger engine.</p>

<p>In carrying out these plans, however, of making the cylinders of steel,
numerous constructional difficulties were encountered which could not be foreseen
when the design was made. Had they been foreseen, provision for obviating
them could easily have been made. As will be seen from the drawing,
Plate <a href="#plt078">78</a>, the engine cylinders consisted primarily of a main outer shell of steel
one-sixteenth of an inch thick, near the bottom end of which was screwed and
brazed a suitable flange, by which it was bolted to the supporting drum or crank
chamber. These shells, which were seamless, with the heads formed integral,
were designed to be of sufficient strength to withstand the force of the explosion
in them, and, in order to provide a suitable wearing surface for the piston,
a cast-iron liner one-sixteenth of an inch thick was carefully shrunk into
them. Entering the side of the cylinder near the top, was the combustion chamber,
machined out of a solid steel forging, which also formed the port which
entered the cylinder and was fastened to it by brazing. The water jackets,
which were formed of sheet steel .020 inch thick, were also fastened to the cylinder
by brazing, and it was in connection with the brazing of these water jackets
that the first serious difficulty was met in the construction of the engine.
In the first place, as the jackets were of an irregular shape and of a different
thickness of metal from the walls of the cylinder to which they were joined,
the expansion and contraction due to the extreme heat necessary for properly
brazing the joints caused such serious strains in various and unexpected directions
that it was only by exercising the very greatest care and patience that
a completely tight joint at all points of the jacket could be secured. In the second
place, the size of the cylinders and the consequently large extent of water-jacket
surface, complicated the problem. The maintenance over this large surface
of the extreme heat necessary for brazing involved discomfort and, indeed,
actual suffering to the person engaged in the work, and much care and skill
were demanded in so distributing the heat that the temperature of the surface
of the jackets would be uniform enough to prevent serious strains from expansion
and contraction. As no workman could be found either competent to do
the work or willing to undergo the personal discomfort, the writer was obliged
to do all this brazing work himself. Besides the difficulties due to the expansion
and contraction of the jackets while they were being brazed, the greatest
care had to be exercised to avoid heating the cylinders
so hot as to weaken the <span class="xxpn" id="p236">[p236]</span>
joint where the explosion chambers were joined to the cylinders, which, of
course, had been brazed before the jackets were fitted to them preparatory to
brazing them.</p>

<p>Another great difficulty was that the ring which encircled the cylinder near
the middle of its length, and which formed the bottom part of the water jacket,
expanded very much more than the cylinder itself, so that, if it was brazed to
the cylinder before the jacket was brazed to it, the heat of brazing the jacket
to the ring would cause the ring to break loose from the cylinder; while if the
ring was not previously brazed to the cylinder, but was brazed after the jacket
had been brazed to it, the very much greater heat required for brazing the ring
to the cylinder caused the spelter to burn out of the joint between the jacket
and the ring. Furthermore, it was found very difficult to braze the two joints
at the same time, since in brazing the ring to the cylinder it was best to have
the cylinder in an inverted vertical position, so that the spelter could be made
to flow evenly around the ring and form a fillet against the wall of the cylinder,
while in brazing the jackets to the ring it was best to have the cylinder
in the reverse vertical position or lying on its side so that the spelter could
properly flow into this joint. Finally, however, after what proved to be most
exasperating and tedious work, the five cylinders necessary for the engine were
completed and a series of tests was immediately made. During the course of
these tests the water circulation became obstructed in several instances, and the
consequent high temperature to which the cylinders and jackets were raised
caused severe strains in the jackets which, in turn, produced breaks in the
brazed joints. These breaks had to be rebrazed, and in brazing them it was
necessary in almost every case to remove the cast-iron liners and rebraze the
entire jackets from start to finish, as the application of the intense heat necessary
for brazing at any one point produced such severe strains that before the
break which was being repaired could be completed other breaks developed at
various points of the jacket. It was, therefore, necessary to get the whole jacket
up to a fairly uniform heat and complete the brazing while it was in this condition,
and then keep the whole cylinder at a uniform but gradually decreasing
temperature until it had sufficiently cooled off.</p>

<p>On account of these troubles with the water jackets and the cylinders, it
was decided to build some extra cylinders, not only because past experience
had suggested improvements in detail in the construction of the jackets, which
would prevent to a large extent the great troubles which had been met with
in the brazed joints, but also to insure having sufficient cylinders to enable the
engine to be always in working condition, even though several of the cylinders
might be out of commission from slight imperfections in the jackets or at other
points. While the construction of these new cylinders involved a repetition of
the arduous task of brazing, yet the minor improvements which
were introduced <span class="xxpn" id="p237">[p237]</span>
proved eminently successful in providing against future troubles from leaky
jackets.</p>

<p>The general form of construction of the engine with the improved cylinders
will be readily understood from the drawings, Plates
<a href="#plt078">78</a>–<a href="#plt081">81</a>, in which Plate
<a href="#plt078">78</a> is a detail sectional view, previously referred to, through one of the cylinders;
Plate <a href="#plt079">79</a> is an end elevation of the port side, Plate <a href="#plt080">80</a> is a plan view, and Plate
<a href="#plt081">81</a> is an elevation of the starboard bed plate which supports that side of the engine,
and by which it was fastened to the aerodrome frame, this view showing
particularly the sparking apparatus which was mounted on the bed plate. The
engine consists primarily of a single crank shaft provided with a single crank
pin, the shaft having bearings in a drum which consists essentially of two heads.
Arranged around the crank shaft and attached at equidistant points of the drum
are five cylinders. Mounted on the port side of the crank shaft and close to the
crank arm is a small gear, which through suitable gears mounted on the port
head of the drum drives a double-pointed cam which has a bearing on the exterior
of the hub of the drum. The ratio of these gears is such that the cam
is driven at one-quarter the speed of the crank shaft, and in the reverse direction.
Mounted on the exterior side of the port head of the drum are five
punch rods, the upper ends of which are within a sixty-fourth of an inch of being
in contact with the exhaust-valve stems of the cylinders, and on the lower
end of these rods are hardened-steel rollers which rest on the double-pointed
cam—this one cam thus serving to operate the exhaust valves of all five of the
cylinders. The port head of the drum is connected to the port bed plate, by
which it is supported, by means of a flanged bushing in which are formed
tongues and grooves which fit into corresponding grooves and tongues formed
in the hub of the drum, it being necessary to have a certain amount of space between
this bed plate and the head of the drum to provide room for the exhaust-valve
cam and its co-acting punch rods. The starboard bed plate is fastened
to the starboard head of the drum by bolts which draw the web of the bed plate
against the face of the drum. The sparking gears are driven by means of a
gear formed on a sleeve which telescopes over the hub of the starboard drum,
and has a bearing thereon, the end of the sleeve terminating in a ring which is
fastened to the crank shaft.</p>

<p>Since the five connecting rods must center on the one crank pin, the bronze
shoes in which they terminate can occupy only a portion of the circumference
of the pin, and with the relative proportions which here existed between the
length of stroke of crank and the length of the connecting rod, the circumferential
width of the connecting-rod shoes was slightly less than sixty degrees,
thus leaving uncovered a crank space of about one-sixth of the circumference,
which it was necessary to have in order to provide room for the change in relative
position of the shoes due to the angularity of the connecting rods. In <span class="xxpn" id="p238">[p238]</span>
the experimental engine the connecting-rod shoes were all given their bearing
directly on the crank pin, as heretofore described, being held in contact therewith
by means of cone nuts, which were screw-threaded to the crank pin, the
taper of the cones permitting adjustment for wear. This method of connecting
these parts to the crank pin is the usual plan of connecting three or more connecting
rods to one crank pin. So much trouble had been experienced with the
water jackets and with minor defects in the experimental engine that no long
runs had been possible with it, and consequently no trouble had been experienced
because of the small amount of bearing area provided by this method of
joining the connecting rods to the crank pin. When, however, the new engine
was completed it was found that after working at high power for a few minutes
the connecting-rod shoes heated so rapidly that it was impossible to run
the engine for more than ten or twelve minutes, the excessive heating of the
shoes causing a great diminution in power besides the danger of serious damage
if the tests were continued longer. At first this defect seemed almost fatal,
as there appeared to be no way of providing sufficient bearing area for the five
connecting rods on one crank pin. Happily, however, the writer was able to
overcome this defect by an improved design which enables all five connecting
rods to operate on the one crank pin, and at the same time provides each with
the full amount of bearing area which it would have were it the only connecting
rod operating on the crank pin. This arrangement consists essentially of a
main connecting rod formed of a steel forging terminating in a sleeve which encircles
the crank pin and is provided with a bronze lining for giving a proper bearing
surface between the connecting rod and the crank pin, both the steel sleeve and
the bronze lining being split, but at right angles to each other, to permit assembling
them on the crank pin. This steel sleeve, the upper half of which is formed
integral with the main connecting rod is rounded off to a true circle on its exterior
circumference, except at the point where the rod joins it. The other four connecting
rods terminating in bronze shoes are then caused to bear on the exterior of
this sleeve, being held in contact therewith, and permitted to have a sliding motion
thereon sufficient to take care of the variation in angularity of the connecting
rods, by means of the cone nuts which are screw-threaded to the sleeve and
locked thereto by means of the jam nuts, as shown in the drawings. The main
connecting rod, of course, acts in the same way as in the ordinary case where
each cylinder has its separate crank pin. The other four connecting rods deliver
their effort to the crank pin through the sleeve in which the first connecting
rod terminates, and they, therefore, do not receive any of the rubbing effect
due to the rotation of the crank pin, except that of slipping a very short distance
over the circumference of the sleeve during each revolution, the amount
of slipping depending on the angularity of the connecting rod. This improved
type of bearing was successful from the time of its first trial,
and even in later <span class="xxpn" id="p239">[p239]</span>
tests in which the engine was run for ten consecutive hours at full power it
showed no signs whatever of overheating. As this new form of connecting-rod
bearing for the crank pin had never been tried before, the precaution was taken
to leave the threads on the crank pin for the cone nuts, so that if this new
bearing should not prove successful the old plan of having the connecting-rod
shoes bear directly on the crank pin could be reverted to. These threads are
clearly seen in Plate <a href="#plt078">78</a> and were never removed from the crank pin, though
their removal would have added considerably to the area of the bearing surface
of the main connecting rod, had more bearing surface seemed necessary.</p>

<p>The lubrication of the main crank-shaft bearing and of the crank pin was
effected by means of a small oil cup, fastened to the port bed plate, which fed
oil through a hole in the hub of the drum to a circular groove formed in the
bronze bushing in the hub. The crank shaft being hollow, a hole was drilled
through it in line with the groove in the bushing, and the oil was then led from
the interior of the crank shaft through a pipe connected to the plug in the end
thereof, and through a hole drilled in the crank arm to the hollow crank pin.
Small holes through the crank pin permitted oil to pass to the exterior thereof
and thus oil the bearing of the main connecting rod. Small holes through the
sleeve and bushing of the main connecting rod fed oil under the shoes of the
other four connecting rods, the small holes being placed in oil grooves formed
in the interior of the bronze bushing. The lubrication of the pistons was effected
by means of small crescent-shaped oil cups fastened to the outer wall
of the cylinders, which distributed the oil equidistantly around the circumference
of the pistons, through small tubes which projected through corresponding
holes drilled in the cylinder wall. These oil cups for the cylinders were,
while small, of sufficient size to furnish a supply for approximately one hour,
and were so positioned on each cylinder as to have a gravity feed. It may be
mentioned here that while there were many parts of the engine which were
of unprecedented lightness there was nothing which excelled these oil cups in
this respect, as they were made of sheet steel .003 of an inch thick, riveted and
soldered up. The crank-shaft bearing in the starboard drum was oiled from
an oil cup mounted on the outside of the bed plate and connected by a pipe to
a hole in the inner wall of the drum, which was connected to the oil grooves in
the bronze bushing in the hub of the drum.</p>

<p>The first set of pistons for this engine were similar in design to those
shown in the assembled drawings, except that they had side walls and heads
which were twice as thick as those shown. These lighter pistons were constructed
later, and were just as good as the earlier and heavier ones. It will be noted
that the pistons have two deep but thin ribs reinforcing the head. The pistons
were slightly tapered from the middle, where they were .005 inch smaller
than the cylinder bore, toward the outer end, where they
were .0075 inch smaller <span class="xxpn" id="p240">[p240]</span>
than the bore. The outer piston ring was .0035 inch narrower than its groove,
the second one .003 inch, the third .0025 inch, and the inner one .002 inch narrower
than its groove. The rings were bored one-sixteenth inch off center with
the exterior surface, and had one-eighth inch diameter of spring. They were
of the lap-joint type, with the sides of the laps carefully fitted
and only one-sixty-fourth-inch
clearance at the ends of the laps to allow for thermal expansion.
As no grinding facilities were obtainable in Washington, the cylinders
were carefully bored smooth and free from taper, and the pistons were worn
in to a perfect fit by running them in by a belt for twenty-four hours, with
copious oil supply.</p>

<p>The main connecting rod was
<span class="nowrap"><span class="fract"><span class="fup">7</span><span class="fdn">8</span></span>-inch</span>
diameter and solid, while the other four
were of the same diameter but with a
<span class="nowrap"><span class="fract"><span class="fup">5</span><span class="fdn">8</span></span>-inch</span>
hole in them. The gudgeon pins
in the pistons were hollow steel tubes
<span class="nowrap"><span class="fract"><span class="fup">7</span><span class="fdn">8</span></span>-inch</span>
diameter and case-hardened, and
were oiled entirely by the oil thrown off by centrifugal force from the crank-pin
bearing, the oil running along the connecting rods and through suitable holes
at the heads into oil grooves in the bronze bushings in these heads.</p>

<p>Since on an engine for an aerodrome the best plan for releasing the exhaust
gases from the engine is to get rid of them as soon as possible, so long as they
are released behind the aviator and do not interfere with his view in the direction
of motion, it was decided to have the gases exhaust immediately from
the combustion chambers; but in order to prevent their playing on and heating
the main bearing of the crank shaft in the port drum the combustion chambers
were each provided with a chamber below the exhaust-valve seat, with a
side outlet therefrom. The manifold pipe through which the gaseous mixture
was supplied to the inlet valves of the engine consisted of a tube bent to a
circle and having five branch tubes, each leading to one of the automatic inlet
valves, which fitted removable cast-iron seats fastened by a nut in the upper
part of each combustion chamber. The very small amount of clearance between
the engine and the frame necessitated that this pipe be cut in three places and
joined by flanges in order to properly assemble it on the engine when the latter
was mounted in the frame. The carburetor, which was placed near the rear of
the aviator’s car, was connected through suitable pipes to this circular inlet
pipe, at a point horizontally in line with the center of the shaft. The auxiliary
air valve consisted of a sleeve rotatably mounted on the vertical pipe leading
from the carburetor to the manifold, holes in the sleeve being brought to coincide
more or less with holes in the vertical pipe, by the operator, when more or
less air was required or when he wished to vary the speed of the engine. The
cooling water for the jackets of the cylinders was led to them through a circular
manifold pipe on the starboard side connected by a vertical pipe with the
centrifugal pump situated at the lower point of the lower pyramid of the aerodrome
frame. The heated water was led from the jackets through another <span class="xxpn" id="p241">[p241]</span> circular
manifold pipe on the port side, through two connections to the radiating
tubes at the front and rear, respectively, of the cross-frame. These radiating
tubes, which were provided with thin radiating ribs soldered to them, finally led
the cooled water to the tank situated in the extreme rear of the aviator’s car,
a suitable pipe from the bottom of this tank being connected to the inlet side of
the centrifugal pump. The centrifugal pump was driven by means of a vertical
shaft connected to the crank shaft through a set of bevel gears which drove
it at three times the speed of the engine. The bearings through which these
gears were connected were mounted on the port bed plate, and in order to allow
for a certain amount of vibration between the engine and the pump this
vertical connecting shaft had a telescoping section connected through suitable
splines.</p>

<p>The sparking apparatus comprised, first, a primary sparker similar to the
simplest form of such devices which have since come into common use, where a
cam driven by the engine co-acts with a pawl on the end of a spring, but in
this case, as this sparker was used for all five cylinders, the cam was driven at
a speed of two and one-half times that of the engine shaft, thus making and
breaking the primary circuit five times in each two revolutions of the engine.
Second, a spark coil, the primary terminals of which were connected to the primary
sparker and to a set of dry batteries. Third, a secondary distributor consisting
of a disc carrying a contact brush and driven at a speed one-half that
of the engine, this brush being constantly connected through a contact ring to
one of the terminals of the high-tension side of the spark coil and running over
the face of a five-section commutator, each of the sections of which was connected
to a spark plug, the other high-tension terminal of the spark coil being,
of course, grounded on the engine frame. This sparking apparatus was first
constructed by using blocks of red fibre for insulation. After the engine was
completed and was being tested difficulties were met with in the sparking apparatus
which at that time appeared inexplicable. After a great deal of annoyance
and loss of time it was finally discovered that the red fibre was not as good
an insulating medium as it was supposed to be, owing to the zinc oxide used
in making it. In damp weather the sparking apparatus absolutely refused to
work, and it was found that the moisture in the air caused the zinc oxide in
the fibre to nullify its insulating qualities. This trouble, after being located,
was cured by substituting hard rubber for the red fibre.</p>

<p>At the time when this engine was built, as well as earlier when the experimental
engine was built, it was impossible to procure any wire which had been
properly insulated to withstand the high voltages necessary for the connections
between the high-tension side of the spark coil and the secondary distributor,
and from the secondary distributor to the spark plugs in the cylinders. While
at this time this appears a very simple matter, yet the trouble
experienced and <span class="xxpn" id="p242">[p242]</span>
the delays caused by the lack of such small accessories which are now so easily
procurable were very exasperating, and it was finally necessary to insulate these
wires by covering them with several thicknesses of ordinary rubber tube of
different diameters telescoped over each other.</p>

<p>In the early tests of this new engine, which were made with it mounted on
a special testing frame and delivering its power to the water-absorption dynamometers,
the engine was operated without any fly wheels, and, so far as its
smoothness of operation was concerned and its ability to generate its maximum
power, it did not require any.</p>

<p>After the completion of the tests on the testing frame the engine was assembled
in the aerodrome frame, which was first mounted on the floor of the
launching car. The car itself was mounted on a short track in the shop, which
arrangement provided a smoothly rolling carriage which could be utilized for
measuring the thrust of the propellers by merely attaching a spring balance between
the rear of the car and a proper holding strap on the track. In the first
tests of the engine under these conditions, it was found that while the engine
itself did not require any fly wheels, yet the lack of them caused trouble with
the transmission and propeller shafts, which, while it had never been anticipated,
was easily understood when it was encountered. This difficulty was
caused by the “reverse torque,” which fluctuated from a maximum to a minimum
five times during each double revolution of the engine, and which set up
fluctuating torsional strains of such magnitude in the transmission and propeller
shafts that the shafts themselves became exceedingly hot after a few minutes
operation of the engine, and under more prolonged periods of operation
these fluctuating torsional strains caused a permanent twisting and bending of
the shafts. The transmission and propeller shafts were at first made of tubing
one-sixteenth of an inch thick, but these were abandoned both on account of the
necessity of abandoning the screw-thread method of attaching the flange couplings
and gears, and also because these shafts had been designed when it was
expected to transmit only twelve horse-power to each propeller, while the increase
of power in the large engine necessarily required much stronger shafts.
The first shafts which were actually tested in the frame were, therefore, one
and one-half inches in diameter by three-thirty-seconds of an inch thick, the tubing
having been one-thirty-second of an inch larger originally and turned down
to this size to insure a straight shaft. When these shafts twisted under the
action of the reverse torque of the engine, a very much heavier set, practically
twice as thick, were constructed. When used in the tests these heavier shafts,
while much stronger, still showed a large amount of heating due to the fluctuating
torsional strains.</p>

<p>Upon calculation it was found that by providing specially light fly wheels
the major portion of this reverse torque could be eliminated
for a less increase <span class="xxpn" id="p243">[p243]</span>
in weight than would be occasioned by sufficiently increasing the thickness of
the transmission and propeller shafts to safely stand it. Since it was desired
to concentrate as much as possible of the weight of the fly wheels in the rims,
the idea at once suggested itself of building them up like a bicycle wheel by
means of tangent spokes. Two steel automobile-wheel rims were therefore procured
thirty-three inches in diameter, and these were provided with tangent
spokes connected to special steel hubs fitted to the crank shaft of the engine.
The rims themselves not being quite heavy enough, and constructional reasons
necessitating their being at different distances from the center of length of the
crank pin, the extra weight which it was desired to give to these rims was provided
by means of steel wire wound tightly around and fastened to the rims,
the weight of each rim being made inversely proportional to its distance from
the center of the crank pin. The first spokes which were used for these wheels
were standard bicycle spokes three-thirty-seconds of an inch in diameter, but
these were soon found to be entirely too weak to withstand the sudden strains
due to the rapid starting of the engine. They were therefore replaced by standard
spokes one-eighth of an inch in diameter, but these also proved too weak
and were later replaced with special spokes made in the shop out of No. 10
coppered-steel wire, which by test was found to have a tensional strength of
2192 pounds. As these steel rims were only one-sixteenth of an inch thick and
had not been made exactly true, but had been straightened before being used,
it was found that they very quickly went out of shape under the strain due to
the centrifugal force at high speeds, and also when the engine was suddenly accelerated.
As long as they did stay true, however, it was found that they were
sufficiently heavy to provide all of the fly-wheel effect it was necessary to have
in order to eliminate all trouble from the reverse torque.</p>

<p>After further consideration, it was decided that the only means of constructing
a fly wheel which would have a stiff rim and at the same time would
not be heavier than the steel ones, which had been found adequate, was by perpetrating
what would at first sight appear to be an absurdity. A new set of
rims for the fly wheels was made by constructing them of an aluminum casting,
the section of the rim being U-shaped. After machining these rims and
assembling the fly wheels with them, it was found that they were many times
stiffer than the previous steel ones of the same weight, and after this change no
further trouble was experienced in keeping the fly wheels perfectly true, even
under the most severe strains. In fact, on one occasion when the engine broke
loose from the propellers, it ran to a speed, which, while not exactly known,
yet reached the limit of the tachometer, which was 2000 R. P. M., without injury
to the fly wheels.</p>

<p>It will be recalled that in starting up the engine on the quarter-size model,
the initial “cranking” necessary with a gasoline
engine was accomplished by <span class="xxpn" id="p244">[p244]</span>
having two of the mechanics turn the propellers. While this same plan might
have been followed in the case of the large aerodrome, yet it would have involved
some danger to the mechanics and would also have left the aviator without
any means of restarting the engine should it for any reason stop while in
the air. Believing it to be very important to provide means for enabling the
aviator to restart the engine in case it stopped in the air, the writer devised
the starting mechanism shown in the drawings, Plates <a href="#plt078">78</a> to
<a href="#plt080">80</a>. Fastened by
tongues and grooves to the port side of the engine crank shaft, just outside of
the bed plate, is a worm wheel, on the hub of which is mounted the bevel gear
which drives the water-circulation pump through the bevel pinion, as already
described. Mounted on the web of the bed plate are two brackets, in which
the shaft for the starting crank is journaled, this shaft passing forward and
downward through the front of the cross-frame of the aerodrome, where it is
journaled in a bracket secured to the brace tubes thereof. At the front or lower
end of the shaft a crank handle is connected thereto by a ratchet mechanism.
The upper end of the starting shaft, between the bearings of
the two supporting
brackets, is tongued and grooved, and slidably mounted thereon with co-acting
grooves and tongues is a worm screw which, in the position shown in
Plates <a href="#plt079">79</a> and <a href="#plt080">80</a>, is in gear with the worm wheel just described. However,
when the worm screw is slid along on the shaft until it is against the upper
bracket it is out of gear with the worm wheel. Mounted in the interior of the
tubular starting shaft is a spring-pressed pawl plug, not shown, but which projects
through one of the tongues on the shaft near the upper bracket. If the
worm screw is slid up against this upper bracket, this pawl catches in a radial
hole in the worm screw and holds it in this position out of gear with the worm
wheel. Connected to this pawl plug and passing longitudinally through the center
of the shaft is a wire which terminates in a button just at the end thereof.
By pulling on this button the operator may release the worm and thus permit
it to slide downward so that when the starting crank is turned in a clockwise
direction the worm will screw itself into gear with the worm wheel, and any
further turning of the starting crank will cause the worm to force the worm
wheel, and, consequently, the engine shaft, around in a clockwise direction. As
soon as the engine gets an explosion the worm wheel slides the worm along
against the upper bracket, where the spring pawl catches and holds it till it
is again released by the operator as before.</p>

<p>This starting mechanism was a success from the first, and the engine was
never started up in any other way. With an aerodrome having the qualities of
automatic equilibrium, which the Langley machines have, it was felt very certain
that by this mechanism the engine could be easily restarted while in the
air, in case it was inadvertently stopped.
<span class="xxpn" id="p245">[p245]</span></p>

<p>The reason for building the engine with five cylinders instead of some other
number, and for arranging them radially on a central drum using only one crank
pin may not appear quite obvious. The advantages gained by such a construction,
however, are very great, and may be briefly summed up as follows:</p>

<p>First, since in a gas engine of the four-cycle type there is only one explosion
in each cylinder every two revolutions, and the crank shaft and crank pin
therefore are loaded only one-quarter of the time for each cylinder, it is obvious
that by having four cylinders arranged radially around a central drum the
load on the bearings of a single crank shaft and crank pin may be kept very
uniform. However, with four cylinders thus arranged it is impossible to have
the cylinders explode and exert their effort on the crank at uniform intervals
in the cycle, it being necessary to have the cylinders explode in the order of
1, 3, 4, 2, 1, etc., thus giving intervals between explosions of 180 degrees, 90 degrees,
180 degrees, 270 degrees, etc., or to have them explode in the order of 1,
3, 2, 4, 1, etc., thus giving intervals of 180 degrees, 270 degrees, 180 degrees, 90
degrees, etc. On the other hand, with any odd number of cylinders the explosions
will occur at equal intervals in the cycle. With three cylinders they will
explode in the order of 1, 3, 2, 1, etc., or at equal intervals of 240 degrees,
while with five cylinders they will explode in the order of 1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 1, etc.,
or at equal intervals of 144 degrees. It is therefore seen that there is a great
advantage in smoothness of operation and uniformity of torque of the engine
through having an odd number of cylinders instead of an even number.</p>

<p>Second, it is readily apparent that the greater the number of cylinders,
provided the number is an odd one, the more uniform the torque will be, and
it would seem at first that seven cylinders would therefore be better than five,
since the uniform intervals between explosions with seven cylinders would be
only 103 degrees (approximately). The advantage gained, however, through
seven cylinders instead of five is largely, if not completely, counterbalanced by
the added number of parts and the difficulty of providing sufficient circumferencial
width for the connecting-rod shoes on the crank-pin bearing, even with
the improved construction of this bearing already described. There is considerable
fluctuation of the torque in each revolution of the engine with five cylinders,
but this fluctuation of torque is more easily smoothed out by the use of
very light fly wheels than by increasing the number of cylinders, and thus
adding to the complication of the engine.</p>

<p>Third, the strongest point in favor of the radially arranged cylinders is the
reduction in weight and complication which it permits. The crank shaft is reduced
to the very minimum, there being only one crank pin with two main
bearings which can, without any difficulty whatever, be kept absolutely in line
with each other and thus prevent binding and loss of power. Again, the use
of a single-throw crank not only reduces the cost and weight of the crank <span class="xxpn" id="p246">[p246]</span>
itself, but makes it very much less liable to damage; long crank shafts with several
crank pins being frequently twisted by improper explosions in the cylinders.
The supporting drum or crank chamber is likewise reduced to the very
minimum, both in weight and simplicity, the drums being perfectly symmetrical
with no lost space either inside of them or on their exteriors. The cam mechanism
for operating the valves is reduced to a simple ring carrying (for a five-cylinder
engine) a double-pointed cam and journaled on the exterior of the hub
of one of the drums, the cam being driven by a train of gears journaled on studs
mounted on the drum, and co-acting with a gear fastened to the crank shaft
against the crank arm.</p>

<p>The radial arrangement of the cylinders is thus seen to give not only an
engine with the smallest number of parts, each of which is as far as possible
worked to a uniform amount during each complete revolution of the crank shaft,
but it also gives a very compact and readily accessible mechanism with its center
of gravity coincident with its center of figure, and with the liability of damage
to it, in case of a smash of the vehicle on which it is used, reduced to the
minimum from the fact that the greatest weight is located at the strongest part.</p>

<p>Fourth, and of almost as great importance as the reduction in weight which
the five-cylinder radial arrangement permits, is its unusual qualities as regards
vibration. Since these five-cylinder engines were built by the writer a very
thorough treatment of their properties as regards balancing has been given in
a treatise on the balancing of engines,<a id="fnanchor_44" href="#footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> so no discussion of the mathematical
formulæ involved in a study of the question of the inherent balancing properties
of these engines will be here given. It is sufficient to call attention to the
fact that in an engine having five cylinders arranged radially, all of the reciprocating
parts are balanced for all forces of the first, second and third orders.
As it is only the reciprocating parts which give any trouble in balancing any
engine, the unbalanced rotating parts being readily balanced by placing an equal
weight at an equal distance from the center of rotation, and on the opposite
side thereof, it is readily seen that the properties of balancing which are inherent
in this type of engine are unusual. A six-cylinder engine having a six-throw
crank shaft is not nearly so thoroughly balanced as this type having its
five cylinders radially arranged, for in the latter case all the moving parts are
in one plane, while in the former case the moving parts are in six separate and
parallel planes, and there is consequently considerable longitudinal vibration
which can never be overcome. While this is true as regards the vibration due
to moving masses, it is still more impressively true as regards vibration due
to reaction arising from the force of the explosions
in the engine cylinders, especially
when the engine is running slowly and having heavy explosions.</p>

<p>The usual practice in balancing the rotating parts of an engine
is to attach <span class="xxpn" id="p247">[p247]</span>
balance weights to the crank arms which are prolonged beyond the center of
the crank shaft and on the opposite side from the crank pin; the radius of rotation
of these balance weights being made approximately equal to the radius of
the crank pin. But aside from the constructional difficulties which would be
introduced, it was seen that if this plan was followed in this engine it would
require a very large additional weight. Since the amount of this weight could
be diminished in exact proportion to the increase of the radius of rotation of
the balance weights, it was at first decided to attach the weights to the rims
of the fly wheels, the relative amount of weight attached to each wheel being
inversely proportional to its actual longitudinal distance from the crank-pin
center. It was very soon found that the attachment of these balance weights
to the fly wheel caused excessive strains on the rims of the wheels, thereby
causing them to go out of line. In order, therefore, to keep the amount of balance
weight small by carrying it at a considerable distance from the center of
the shaft, the weights were finally arranged as clearly shown in the drawings,
Plates <a href="#plt078">78</a> to <a href="#plt080">80</a>. There it is seen that the main portion of each of the balance
weights consists of a flat arm bolted between the flanges which couple the transmission
shafts to the engine shafts. The flat arm terminates in a lozenge-shaped
lug, additional weight being provided by a plate fastened to one end of a tube,
the other end of which terminates in a collar fastened around the transmission
shaft. The tube is inclined at an angle of about thirty degrees with the
flat balance arm, thus acting as a brace to prevent the balance arm from wobbling,
the plate on the bracing tube being fastened to the lozenge-shaped lug
by means of small bolts.</p>

<p>The tabulated statement of the weight of this large engine is given below.
From this it will be readily seen that the net weight of the engine proper is
124.17 pounds. The fly wheels were in no way necessary to the engine itself,
but were used solely for the purpose of smoothing out the torque of the engine
so that the transmission shafts and propeller shafts might be kept down to the
very minimum in weight. Including the two fly wheels, the weight is 140 pounds.</p>

<p>Including the 20 pounds of cooling water the total weight of the power
plant is 207.47 pounds. Without flywheels the total weight is 191.64 pounds.</p>

<p>The construction of this large engine was completed in December, 1901,
and the first tests of it were made in January, 1902. As already stated, these
first tests were made with the engine mounted on a special testing frame and
delivering its power to two water-absorption dynamometers, no fly wheels being
used, as none were required. Later, when it became necessary either to
use fly wheels or to greatly increase the weight of the transmission and propeller
shafts, in order to overcome the reverse torque, the two light fly wheels
were added, and another series of tests was made of the engine on its testing
frame. The arrangement of the engine, dynamometers, and
accessory <span class="xxpn" id="p248">[p248]</span> apparatus
is clearly shown in Plates <a href="#plt082">82</a>, <a href="#plt083">83</a> and
<a href="#plt084">84</a>. The engine ran in a clockwise
direction, as viewed in Plate <a href="#plt082">82</a>. <em class="italic">AA</em> are the fly wheels;
<em class="italic">BB</em> the balance weights;
<em class="italic">CC</em> the dynamometer shafts, on which are fastened the rotor plates which revolve
inside of the dynamometer drums, <em class="italic">DD</em>, between stator plates fastened
therein. The drums have a hub on either side, by which they are supported,
these hubs being journaled on ball-bearings in the pedestals resting on the
wooden framework. The rotor plates do not touch the stator plates in the dynamometers,
but drag on the water with which the drums are partially filled,
and thus tend to cause the drums to revolve around with them. The torque on
each drum is measured by means of a rope, not shown, fastened into the hook
at the top of the drum, the rope being given a partial coil around the drum and
passing off tangent thereto at the horizontal diameter is fastened to a pair of
spring scales hung from the ceiling vertically above the point of tangency. The
scales and ropes were unfortunately not in position when these photographs
were taken, but the arrangement of them should be readily understood. As the
friction of the rotor plates on the water heats it in exact proportion to the
amount of power absorbed, the small amount of water in the drums would be
soon converted into steam unless continually renewed or cooled. When the rotor
plates are revolving the centrifugal force keeps the water pressed toward the
circumference of the drum, and the friction at any speed is dependent on the
area of the rotor plates in contact with the water. The horse-power required
to revolve the plates at any definite speed can therefore be controlled by having
an outlet for the water at the proper radial distance from the shaft. The
water from the water mains is led through the upper vertical pipe and allowed
to flow into the funnel, and thence into the drum near the center where the centrifugal
force throws it to the circumference of the drum. The lower vertical
pipe is connected to the drum at a suitable radial distance from the center, and
the heated water thus passes through this pipe and into the lower funnel connected
to the sewer. By the use of the funnels the drums are allowed to rock
sufficiently to exert their pull on the spring scales without being affected by the
supply and exhaust of water.</p>

<p>The water for cooling the cylinders is led from the bottom of the tank <em class="italic">E</em>
to the circulating pump <em class="italic">F</em>, supported in a discarded lower pyramid of the aerodrome
frame, the pump being driven by the small vertical shaft, as already
described. The water, after passing through the pump and the engine cylinders,
is led back to the upper part of the tank. By suitable connections to the
water mains and sewer, the water in the tank is kept at any desired temperature.
The gasoline supply tank is seen on the left-hand side of the testing
frame, as viewed in Plate <a href="#plt082">82</a>, the carburetor being placed below it and the gas
supply pipe from the carburetor passing through the gasoline tank. Instead of
jacketing the carburetor, a grid formed of thin copper tubes is supported just
above the multitude of small air pipes leading
into the carburetor, and some of <span class="xxpn" id="p249">[p249]</span>
the hot water from the engine is by-passed through this grid and thus warms
the air as it passes into the carburetor. The small pipe that by-passes this
water through the grid is seen connected to the outlet water pipe just above
the cylinders, a small butterfly valve in the outlet pipe enabling the amount of
heated water passing through the grid to be controlled. The return from the
grid is by means of the small pipe leading to the top of the large water tank.
The tachometer, which gives instantaneous readings of the speed of the engine,
is seen at <em class="italic">G</em>, where it is at all times in full view of the operator.</p>

<p>These dynamometers proved to be excellently suited for the testing work,
and far ahead of anything else the writer has ever found for engine testing.
Since the power required to rotate the rotor plates, with a uniform amount
of water in the drums, varies as the cube of the speed, it is readily seen that it
is impossible for the engine to race or injure itself by running away, as frequently
happens where there is no engine governor and Prony brakes are used
to measure the power.</p>

<p>In the early tests the engine was never allowed to develop more than 40
horse-power, as it was feared that by letting it develop more, which it was
clearly seen to be capable of, it might be injured and cause a delay in the tests
of the aerodrome. In the second series of tests it was allowed to develop 51
horse-power at 935 R. P. M., but it was not thought to be advisable to let it run
at maximum power for more than an hour, for the same reason as before. In
the summer of 1904, after it was seen that there was no immediate possibility of
securing funds for continuing the tests of the aerodrome, it was planned to
enter the engine in the competitive tests at the St. Louis Exposition, where a
prize of $2500 was offered for the lightest engine for its power. As the conditions
specified in this competition required that the engine run at its maximum
power for one hour, and that this be followed by a durability test of ten hours’
continuous running, it was decided to make some durability tests of the engine
before taking it to St. Louis. In these tests, the engine was run on three separate
trials for a period of ten hours<a id="fnanchor_45" href="#footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> with a constant load of 52.4 horse-power
at 950 R. P. M. Even in these long durability tests the engine and the dynamometers
both worked so smoothly and evenly that the engine did not vary its
speed more than ten revolutions per minute, and the pull on the spring scales
varied less than ten pounds in the entire ten hours. Considerable correspondence
was had with the officials of the St. Louis Exposition regarding the entrance
of the engine in the competition, in order to make sure that suitable
facilities for conducting the tests had been provided. After receiving assurance
that everything necessary had been provided, the engine and its testing dynamometers
were boxed for shipment to St. Louis and arrangements were just
being completed for their transportation when the following telegram was <span class="xxpn" id="p250">[p250]</span>
received from the director in charge of the aeronautical department of the Exposition:
“On account of lack of competition engine tests abandoned.” As
the main object of entering the engine in the competition was to insure for it
an unquestioned record of its performance it was decided to reassemble it in
the testing frame in Washington and invite some engineers of prominence to
witness and certify to its performance, but on account of the lack of funds for
meeting the expenses incident to such a series of tests as it was planned to
make this was never done.</p>

<p>In the tests which were witnessed on April 26, 1902, by Captain I. N. Lewis,
Recorder of the Board of Ordnance and Fortification, the engine was held down
to a pull of 200 pounds on a 13-inch lever, when running at 1000 revolutions per
minute. In the later tests in May, 1903, which were witnessed by Captain Gibson,
who was then Recorder of the Board of Ordnance and Fortification, and
Mr. G. H. Powell, the Secretary of the Board, the engine was allowed to work
at a pull of 265 pounds on the 13-inch lever arm at a speed of 950 revolutions
per minute. In the tests made in August, 1904, the engine was run for ten consecutive
hours<a id="fnanchor_46" href="#footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> at a pull which varied from 263 to 271 pounds, or an average of
267 pounds, on a 13-inch lever, with the speed varying from 945 to 955 revolutions
per minute, thus showing 52.4 horse-power at the average speed of 950 R. P. M.</p>

<h3 title="Chapter XI.
Shop Tests of the Aerodrome.">CHAPTER XI<br />
SHOP TESTS OF THE AERODROME</h3></div>

<p>In June, 1902, after the proper adjustments of the carburetor and other
accessories of the engine had been accurately determined in the tests on the testing
frame, the engine was assembled in its proper position in the aerodrome
frame and connected to the propellers. The aerodrome frame was then mounted
directly on the floor of the launching car, which was placed on a short track
laid on the floor of the shop, as previously described. A large spring balance,
which had been previously calibrated, was then connected between the car and
an upright fastened to the track, and tests were made to determine the thrust
developed when the engine drove the propellers at different speeds. Upon finding
that there was comparatively little vibration when the engine was driving
the propellers even at its maximum speed, it was felt safe to raise the aerodrome
from the floor of the car and place it upon the uprights on which it would
be supported in launching it. Quite an extended series of tests was then
made, and although the uprights raised the aerodrome frame until the midrod
was practically 9 feet from the floor of the car, and in the tests at maximum
power the propellers developed an average thrust of 450 pounds, yet it was
found that the clutch hook held the bearing points of the frame so securely on
the uprights of the car that all fear that the aerodrome might break loose from
the car during the launching process was removed.</p>

<p>Upon the completion of these tests, which had proved most satisfactory,
the aerodrome frame was supported from the ceiling of the shop by means of
four short coil springs which reproduced as nearly as possible the elastic or
flexible suspension which the aerodrome would have when supported by its
wings in the air. These springs were attached at the same points on the
main frame of the aerodrome at which the wings would be attached, thus permitting
a careful study of the amount of flexure and vibration which it would
undergo in actual flight. The most remarkable difference in the nature of the
vibration induced in the frame was found when the aerodrome was thus
supported by springs. When it was supported on the rather unyielding launching
car, the general tremor set up in the frame by the engine and propellers
was, while small, yet harsh, the effect on a person standing in the aviator’s car
being rather unpleasant in the joints of the knees when experienced for several
minutes. When the frame was suspended by the springs it was found that all
this harshness of tremor disappeared, it being replaced by a slight general and
rapid tremor of the whole frame, which was not at all unpleasant, and which <span class="xxpn" id="p252">[p252]</span>
had no tiring effect on one standing in the aviator’s car. In fact, the vibration
in the first case resembled rather closely that of a motor vehicle supported on
wheels having metal tires, and in the second case a motor vehicle supported on
wheels having pneumatic tires.</p>

<p>As in these tests in the shop it was impossible to keep the engine cool by
circulating its cooling water through the radiator, since there was no air current
blowing across the latter to carry away the heat, it was necessary to connect
an extra water tank in the cooling-water circuit. A tank holding about ten
gallons was used, and this sufficed for about ten minutes before the water was
raised to the boiling point.</p>

<p>During one of these tests when the frame was supported from the springs,
and while the engine was developing about fifty horse-power, without any warning
whatever, both propellers suddenly twisted off from the flanges by which
they were connected to the propeller shafts, thus leaving the engine entirely unloaded.
The propellers both dropped quietly to the floor, making only about
one or two turns in falling the distance of approximately 10 feet, and the engine,
which had been running at about 850 R. P. M., immediately speeded up
to an exceedingly high speed, which, while not exactly known, since the tachometer
only read to 2000 R. P. M., yet from the deflection produced on the tachometer
needle must have been considerably higher than this. Although the fly wheels,
which were 33 inches in diameter, with the aluminum rims and wire spokes,
had been exceedingly well made, yet it was not considered safe to run them
at this speed, and the engine was immediately shut down. At the moment, however,
that the engine had broken loose from its propellers and also momentarily
jumped to this exceedingly high speed there was absolutely no vibration that
could be noticed, the unloaded engine running as smoothly as an electric motor.
This showed very clearly that the running balance of the engine was as near
perfect as it would be possible to get it, except with a seven-cylinder engine,
which is theoretically capable of more perfect balance. It was evident that what
small vibration there was in the frame while the engine was developing its
power was due almost entirely to the reverse torque, and, of course, could never
be entirely eliminated.</p>

<p>In the tests of the engine working in the frame, both while mounted on the
car and also when suspended from the springs, a great amount of delay was
caused from the fact that the ball-bearings on the transmission and propeller
shafts frequently went to pieces. There were two reasons for this: In the first
place, although carefully selected balls were used, defective ones were continually
encountered. Even a slight defect in a single ball resulted in its breaking
under the rather severe test to which they were subjected, and, as is well known,
the breaking of one ball in a ball-bearing usually results in the destruction of
the whole bearing, especially if the races are light. The second cause was that <span class="xxpn" id="p253">[p253]</span>
the whole aerodrome had been originally designed with the expectation of using
a maximum of 24 horse-power, and as no margin had been left to provide for
possible increases in the size of the bearings, there was no room to permit them
to be increased without almost completely reconstructing portions of the transverse
frame. While in the end it would have been cheaper to have reconstructed
these portions in order to put in larger bearings, yet, as is always the case in
experimental work of this kind, small changes which seem to hold out hope of
overcoming difficulties are usually followed, rather than reconstructions which
can be seen to involve considerable expense and delay. After a number of minor
changes had been made in the bearings, they were finally able to stand up fairly
well under the severe strain to which they were subjected when the engine developed
its full power, and no further changes were made in them; a defective
race being, however, replaced by a new one as occasion demanded.</p>

<p>These tests demonstrated very clearly that at speeds of approximately 1000
revolutions per minute ball-bearings which are subjected to considerable loads
should be calculated with a considerable margin of safety, as the yielding of
the frame, which must necessarily be far from rigid, causes more or less error
in the alignment of the shafts and bearings, and this introduces considerably
increased strains on the bearings. In the early tests before the bearings were
strengthened, the balls in some of the races were on a few occasions ground to
a very fine powder before it was discovered that they had failed. Such a result,
it will be understood, could and did occur in the course of a very minute length
of time.</p>

<p>In imitating as nearly as possible the conditions to which the carburetor
of the engine would be subjected during the period of launching, numerous tests
were made in which the engine was brought to its maximum speed and, without
changing the adjustment of the mixture-controlling devices of the carburetor,
sudden blasts of air were turned on it from various directions, and these were
continued until the mixture-control devices were perfected to such a point that
gusts of thirty miles an hour suddenly directed from any point against any
portion of the apparatus would in no way effect the speed and power of the engine.
These tests were considered necessary in view of the very sudden changes
in conditions to which the aerodrome would be subjected during its brief run
down the launching track, the conditions changing in approximately three seconds
from absolute quiescence of the aerodrome to a plunge through space at
thirty-five feet per second. An aviator would be more than occupied with maintaining
control of himself and of the aerodrome, which at the moment of leaving
the track might require considerable change in the adjustment of the Pénaud
tail, and he would, therefore, not be able to make any
adjustments of the engine-control
devices. This supposition was entirely confirmed in the actual tests of
the aerodrome which are to be later described, the rush down the
track being <span class="xxpn" id="p254">[p254]</span>
so very brief that the engine could not have been given any attention by the
aviator had it needed it, which fortunately it did not.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to recount at any length the great difficulties which
was experienced in these tests of the engine in the aerodrome frame before
the shafts, bearings, propellers, and, in fact, the frame itself were all properly
co-ordinated so that confidence could be felt that all of the parts would stand
the strains which were likely to come on them when the aerodrome was in flight.
These tests were really not tests of the engine itself, but of the frame, shafts,
and bearings. Suffice it to say that nearly a year was consumed by the various
breakages of the shafts, bearings, and propellers before it was felt that all of
these parts could be depended on, and even then the weakness of the bearings
above referred to was fully recognized. Had some of the better-grade balls
and steels for the bearings, which have since that time come on the market,
been obtainable then, there would have been no difficulty with these bearings.
However, this same remark might be made with reference to nearly all of the
details of the aerodrome, for it was the accessories, such as bearings for the
transmission and propeller shafts, spark plugs, coils, batteries, and a suitable
carburetor for the engine, that caused the chief delay after the main difficulty
of getting a suitable engine had been overcome.</p>

<h3 title="Chapter XII.
Field-trials in 1903.">CHAPTER XII<br />
FIELD-TRIALS IN 1903
</h3></div>

<p>The extended series of shop tests which had occupied a considerable portion
of the late winter and early spring of 1903 had demonstrated the following
facts: First, with the aerodrome mounted on the launching car, a propeller
thrust of from 450 to 475 pounds could be maintained indefinitely by the engine,
and even when the engine was delivering its full power to the propellers,
the vibration was so small as to cause no apprehension that the wings and rudder
would be made to vibrate sufficiently to produce undue strains in them.
Second, with the aerodrome suspended from the ceiling by springs at the points
at which the wings would be attached, the vibration produced by the engine developing
it’s full power was even less than when the machine was mounted on
the launching car and there was, consequently, even less cause for concern that
the wings and rudder might be set in vibration when the machine was free in
the air. Third, the engine could be depended upon to deliver something over
52 horse-power when the five cylinders were working properly, and even with
one cylinder not working, but acting as a dead load against the others, approximately
35 horse-power could be developed, while with two cylinders not working
at all, the three which were working would deliver about 25 horse-power.
Therefore, even assuming that two of the five cylinders might become deranged
during a flight, there should still be sufficient power to propel the machine.
These tests, some of which had been witnessed by members of the Board of
Ordnance and Fortification, clearly demonstrated that the time had arrived when
it was safe to give the aerodrome a test in free flight. The machine itself together
with all its appurtenances and much extra material for repairs in case
of breakages, which previous experience had shown to be almost certain, was
accordingly taken from the shop and placed on the house-boat preparatory to
taking it down the river to the point opposite Widewater, Va., which had already
been selected as the “experimental ground.”</p>

<p>Owing to the limited size of the shops it had been impossible to place the
wings and rudder in their proper positions on the aerodrome and determine its
balancing in a way similar to that practiced with the models. The approximate
settings for the wings and rudder had, however, been determined by calculation
from the data obtained in the test of the quarter-size model, so that it remained
only to place the wings and a weight to represent the rudder actually
on the machine in the large space of the house-boat (which, however, was not
large enough to permit the rudder to be assembled along with the wings), and
thus check the balancing previously determined by calculation.
There were very <span class="xxpn" id="p256">[p256]</span>
few appurtenances which could be shifted in balancing the aerodrome, but the
proper disposition of weight had been so accurately determined by calculation
that the floats, which, as will be seen from the various photographs, were merely
cylindrical tanks with pointed ends, and of a sufficient capacity to cause a displacement
great enough to float the aerodrome when it came down into the water,
proved sufficient ballast for shifting the center of gravity to its proper point.
The flying weight of the aerodrome was 830 pounds,<a id="fnanchor_47" href="#footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> including the weight of the
writer, which was 125 pounds. The total area of the wings or supporting surfaces
was 1040 square feet, or the ratio of supporting surface to weight was
1.25 square feet per pound, which is the same as .8 pound per square foot.</p>

<p>After the balancing of the large aerodrome had been completed on the
house-boat, and everything else got in readiness as far as could be done before
actually arriving at the point at which the test was to be made, the house-boat
was towed down the river on July 14, 1903, and fastened to its mooring buoy,
which had been placed in the middle of the river at a point practically opposite
Widewater, Va., and approximately forty miles from Washington. See Coast-Survey
Chart, Plate <a href="#plt085">85</a>.</p>

<p>Sleeping quarters for the force of eight workmen and the regular soldier
from the United States Army, who had been detailed as a special guard, had
been provided on the boat, but owing to the lack of space it had been found impracticable
to arrange proper cooking facilities on the boat, and it had been
found necessary to arrange to transport the workmen to Chopawamsic Island,
near Quantico, Va., for their meals. It had been planned to use the twenty-five-foot
power launch for this purpose, but owing to the heavy storms which
became quite frequent soon after the house-boat was taken down the river, it
was found that the small launch was not sufficient, and it was necessary to
employ a tug-boat and keep it stationed there at all times. This added very
considerably to the expense of the experiments, as the hire of this one tug-boat
very nearly equalled the pay-roll of the workmen, and while it was not
expected that the stay down the river would be so greatly prolonged as afterwards
proved the case it was felt certain that minor delays were sure to occur
and the experiments would at the very least require several weeks.</p>

<p>Had it been possible to foresee the great delay which finally occurred before
the large aerodrome was actually launched, and the great expense arising
from the necessity of maintaining one or more expensive tug-boats constantly,
it is very certain that an experimental station nearer Washington would have
been selected, even though the nearer places on the river which were available
were much less suitable, both on account of the river being much narrower and
the traffic very much heavier. In fact, at the time that the house-boat was taken
down the river on July 14, with the expectation that
the experiments with the <span class="xxpn" id="p257">[p257]</span>
large aerodrome would certainly be concluded within four weeks, the expenses
of the work, which had been met from the Hodgkins Fund of the Smithsonian
Institution since the original allotment from the Board of Ordnance and Fortification
was exhausted more than a year previously, had already made such
heavy drafts on this fund that Mr. Langley was most reluctant to draw further
on it, even to the extent which seemed necessary to meet the expenses of a
month of “field-work.”</p>

<p>Before making the tests of the large aerodrome, it was intended to give
the quarter-size model a preliminary trial to test the balancing which it was
proposed to use on the large machine. For this test it was planned to employ
the small launching apparatus mounted on top of the small house-boat, which
had been used in the experiments with the steam-driven models Nos. 5 and 6
in 1899, and later with the quarter-size model in 1901. However, after arriving
down the river, it was found that the small house-boat which had been
anchored at Chopawamsic Island since the experiments in 1901 had deteriorated
to such an extent that it was unsafe to take it out into the river. The launching
apparatus for the model was, therefore, removed from it and placed on the turn-table
of the large house-boat, alongside the launching track for the large machine.
After completing this transfer of the model-launching apparatus everything
was thought to be in readiness for a test of the quarter-size model, but
upon making a shop test of the model to make sure that its engine was working
properly, it was found impossible to get it to work at all. A few explosions
could be obtained once in a while, but very irregularly. After spending considerable
time in trying to locate the difficulty, it was found that the commutator
which distributes the high-tension sparking current to the proper cylinder at
the proper time was short-circuited. This commutator had been made of “insulating
fibre” and had never caused any previous trouble. It was now found,
however, that the very damp atmosphere which had been experienced during
the preceding two weeks, when the fog for a large portion of the time was so
heavy that objects at a short distance across the water could not be seen, had
caused the moisture to penetrate the fibre and thus destroy its insulating qualities.
After much trouble some vulcanite and mica were secured and a new commutator
made to replace the fibre one, and, then, after some minor difficulties
had been remedied, the engine for the model was got into good condition again.
After getting satisfactory shop tests on the model aerodrome, and having everything
in readiness for a flight, it was necessary to wait many days before the
weather was calm enough for a test. However, on August 8 the weather quieted
down and the model was launched at 9.30 a. m. into a wind blowing about 12
miles per hour from E. SE.</p>

<p>Referring to Plate <a href="#plt086">86</a>, which shows the quarter-size model mounted on its
launching car on top of the large house-boat,
and which was taken only a few <span class="xxpn" id="p258">[p258]</span>
minutes before the model was actually launched, it will be noted that a board
(<em class="italic-padr">A</em>) projects from the front of the launching car. This board, which is mounted
in a false floor of the launching car, is so arranged that when it strikes the two
blocks (<em class="italic-padr">B</em>) at the end of the track it is driven backward in the car against the
triggers which prevent the uprights (<em class="italic-padr">D</em>), supporting the aerodrome, from being
folded down against the floor. When this board strikes the triggers it releases
them and the springs (<em class="italic-padr">C</em>), which in this case were rubber bands, immediately
fold the vertical posts or uprights (<em class="italic-padr">D</em>) against the brace posts (<em class="italic-padr">E</em>), which are
immediately folded down flat against the floor of the car through the action of
the spring hinges, by which they are connected to it. These uprights (<em class="italic-padr">D</em>),
which support the aerodrome at the front and rear, respectively, are not released
until a fraction of a second after the release of the clutch hook (<em class="italic-padr">F</em>),
which is attached to the middle upright (<em class="italic-padr">G</em>), and which, grasping the lower
pyramid, holds the machine down firmly against the uprights (<em class="italic-padr">D</em>) previously
referred to. In order to prevent the possibility of the aerodrome being released
prematurely while the car is held at the extreme rear end of the track
by the hook (<em class="italic-padr">H</em>), a steel pin (<em class="italic-padr">J</em>), which can just be seen in the photograph, is
pushed through a hole in the board (<em class="italic-padr">A</em>), and into a hole in a cross-member on
the bottom of the car, thus holding the board in its proper position. After the
engine is started up one of the mechanics who has assisted in starting it is
under orders to remove the pin at the word “Ready,” and at the word “Go”
the other mechanic who has assisted in starting the engine is under orders to
release the hook (<em class="italic-padr">H</em>), and thus allow the car to dash down the track. In the
experiment on August 8 the mechanic failed to remove the pin (<em class="italic-padr">J</em>) at the proper
time, and it was only after the machine had been released and started down
the track that it was seen that the pin had not been removed. It was then,
however, too late to stop it, so the car dashed down the track. Although the
striking of the board against the blocks caused the pin to split the board to
pieces, the launching apparatus worked perfectly and the aerodrome started off
on a perfectly even keel, the propellers revolving at an exceedingly high rate
of speed. The aerodrome flew straight ahead for a distance of 350 feet, when
it began to circle towards the right, descending slightly as it circled. Upon
completing a quarter circle it again began to rise, flying straight ahead until
it had gone a similar distance, when it again lost headway, but before it reached
the water the engine increased its speed and the aerodrome again rose. When
the engine slowed down for the third time, however, the aerodrome was not many
feet above the river, so that before the engine regained its normal speed the
aerodrome touched the water with its propellers still revolving, but very slowly.
While the total distance covered was only about 1000 feet, and the time that it
was actually in the air 27 seconds, yet in this brief time it had served the main
purpose for which it had been built, which was
to find out if the balancing of <span class="xxpn" id="p259">[p259]</span>
the large aerodrome, which had been determined by calculation from the results
obtained with the steam-driven models, was correct. For it was assumed that
if the quarter-size model, which was an exact counterpart of the large machine,
should fly successfully with the same balancing as that calculated for the large
one, the large one could reasonably be expected to act similarly. It was at first
thought best to make another test with the model immediately after recovering
it from the water, but by the time it could be brought into the house-boat and
the water which had got into the engine cylinders could be removed and the
engine made to work properly quite a strong wind had sprung up and rendered
further tests of the model on this day impossible. If the launching track for the
small machine could have remained on the top of the boat without interfering
with the completion of the preparations for testing the large machine, it would
have been left there and other tests made with the model when the weather was
suitable, but as this could not be done without interfering with the work on
the large machine, and the delays with the model had already been so great, the
small track was immediately removed and the model stored away in the house-boat
for possible later tests.</p>

<p>At the first it was impossible to account for the engine on the model running
so irregularly and slowing down so soon after it was launched, as it was
felt very certain that the cylinders could not in so short a time, and with the
aerodrome actually moving through the air, have heated up sufficiently to cause
it. After a while, however, one of the workmen volunteered the information
that in his zeal to fill the fuel tank completely so as to insure a long flight,
he had caused the tank to overflow so that some of the gasoline had run into
the intake pipe, and that he had noticed gasoline dripping from the intake pipe
as the machine went down the track. This excess gasoline in the intake pipe
had caused the mixing valve which controls the quality of the explosive mixture
to be improperly set, so that it would not furnish the proper mixture when
the fuel was supplied in the proper way by the carburetor, and consequently
when this excess gasoline had evaporated, the mixture furnished to the engine
was not proper, and it consequently slowed down, there being no human intelligence
on board to correct the adjustment of the mixing valve.</p>

<p>A series of seven photographs of this flight of the quarter-size model is
given in Plates <a href="#plt087">87</a> to <a href="#plt093">93</a>.
Plate <a href="#plt087">87</a>, taken with a kodak from the tug-boat stationed
several hundred yards directly ahead of the house-boat, shows the machine
in full flight heading directly for the tug-boat. Although the aerodrome
was about fifteen or twenty feet higher above the level of the water than the
camera, still, at the considerable distance from which the photograph was taken,
this view would not show so much of the under side unless the machine had
been pointing upward. The photograph also proves very clearly that at the
time it was taken the machine had certainly
not dropped at all below the level <span class="xxpn" id="p260">[p260]</span>
at which was launched. In Plate <a href="#plt088">88</a> the camera was unfortunately not well
aimed, and only the front guy-post, bearing points, float and bowsprit are visible,
besides the blur of the propellers, which, it will be noted, were moving
very rapidly. The camera with which this and the succeeding plates were taken
was one of the two special telephoto cameras belonging to the Zoological Park,
but built in the course of the aerodromic work and used where especially rapid
shutters were needed. As the shutters on these cameras give an exposure of
only
<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">500</span></span>
of a second, and consequently are sufficiently rapid to show the individual
feathers in a rapidly moving bird’s wing, any distortion of the machine
in flight would certainly have been shown, but, as will be seen from the
later photographs, no distortion of any kind occurred, both the surfaces and
the framework remaining in a perfectly straight condition. Near the bottom
of Plate <a href="#plt088">88</a> is the tug from which Plate <a href="#plt087">87</a> was taken, and a careful inspection
of Plate <a href="#plt087">87</a> shows two persons standing on the roof of the house-boat, below
the upper works, the gentleman on the left being Mr. Thomas W. Smillie, the
official photographer of the Smithsonian Institution, who took all of the photographs
except Plate <a href="#plt087">87</a>, and, as stated above, used therefor the special telephoto
cameras with the rapid shutters. Plate <a href="#plt089">89</a> is an exceedingly good view, and
shows the propellers revolving very rapidly while Plates <a href="#plt090">90</a>,
<a href="#plt091">91</a> and <a href="#plt092">92</a> show very
clearly that the speed of the propellers had greatly decreased between the successive
photographs. Plate <a href="#plt093">93</a> shows the aerodrome shortly after it touched
the water and had been almost completely submerged, in spite of its floats, by
the very strong tide which was running. Though these plates show all that
photographs can, they give no adequate idea of the wonder and beauty of the
machine when actually in flight. For while the graceful lines of the machine
make it very attractive to the eye even when stationary, yet when it is actually
in flight it seems veritably endowed with life and intelligence, and the spectacle
holds the observer awed and breathless until the flight is ended. It seems hardly
probable that anyone, no matter how skeptical beforehand, could witness a flight
of one of the models and note the almost bird-like intelligence with which the
automatic adjustments respond to varying conditions of the air without feeling
that, in order to traverse at will the great aerial highway man no longer needs
to wrest from nature some strange, mysterious secret, but only, by diligent
practice with machines of this very type, to acquire an expertness in the management
of the aerodrome not different in kind from that acquired by every
expert bicyclist in the control of his bicycle.</p>

QUARTER-SIZE MODEL AERODROME AT END OF FLIGHT,

<a class="linka" href="#listplates">◊</a>
</div>
</div>

<p>In describing this flight immediately after it was made, Professor John M.
Manly, who took the photograph shown in Plate <a href="#plt087">87</a>, said: “The flight of the
small aerodrome was an event which all who saw it will remember for the
rest of their lives. We were, of course, in a state of considerable nervous excitement
and tension, for, after weeks of delay from
high winds, rains, and <span class="xxpn" id="p261">[p261]</span>
other uncontrollable causes, at last we had a day ideally suited to the test. This
was, to be sure, not the great test, the final test, the test of the man-carrying
flyer, but it was felt by all to be of almost equal importance, for if the balancing
of the small aerodrome was correct, the large one would maintain its
equilibrium, and the problem of human flight would be solved practically as
well as theoretically. That the weather was now favorable for the test filled
us with excitement. Again and again the favorable moment had seemed to
come, and had gone again before we could make ready for it. The aerodrome
was rapidly carried to the upper works of the house-boat and the observers
and helpers went hastily to their positions. The large tug-boat was stationed
directly ahead, almost in the line of flight, and about a mile from the
house-boat. Signals of readiness were exchanged, and with every sense astrain
we awaited the supreme moment. The rocket gave the starting signal, and instantly
there rushed towards us, moving smoothly, without a quiver of its wings,
with no visible means of motion and no apparent effort, but with tremendous
speed, the strange new inhabitant of the air. Onward it moved, looking like a
huge white moth, but seeming no creature of this world, not only on account
of its size, its ease of movement and its wonderful speed, but also because of its
strange, uncanny beauty. It seemed visibly and gloriously alive as it advanced,
growing rapidly larger and more impressive. Straight at us it came, and for
a moment there was a wild fear that it would come right on and crush itself
against the ponderous tug-boat. There was a half impulse to move the tug-boat
out of its way, but the aerodrome seemed to realize its danger and rapidly,
though not abruptly or violently, as
if it had intelligence and power of self-direction,
it checked its speed and circled to the right, descending slightly. Soon
it quickened its speed again and went straight ahead for about ten seconds,
when it again checked its flight and descended, circling once more. Once again
it attempted to increase its speed and rise, but it was too near the water, and
in a few moments the waves had wet its propellers and wings, and it sank, a
poor, bedraggled creature. But the vision of its beauty and power and seeming
intelligence and life will long remain with those who saw its flight.”</p>

<p>After removing the model-launching track so that the final arrangements
could be completed for testing the large machine, many weeks of delay were
experienced, almost entirely due to the unusually bad weather conditions which
prevailed, and which were unprecedented for the time of the year. However,
on September 3 the weather became more suitable, and the aerodrome being in
readiness the metal frame of the large machine was hoisted to the top of the
boat and placed on the launching car, and the wings, rudder, etc., were then
hoisted up and properly assembled and everything made ready for a flight.
The parties with the telephoto cameras were sent to their stations on the shore,
where definite base lines had been marked out so that with the data as to <span class="xxpn" id="p262">[p262]</span>
altitude
and azimuth, which these cameras automatically recorded, the speed, height,
etc., of the machine in flight could be accurately computed. After stationing
the tug-boats at proper points, so as to render assistance should the aerodrome
come down into the water at a considerable distance from the house-boat, it was
found, upon attempting to start the engine, that for some reason it would not
operate. The sparking battery which had been placed at the extreme rear of
the aerodrome was found to be giving such a weak spark that it would not
ignite the mixture in the cylinders. Upon removing the connection which
grounded the terminal of the battery to the framework and replacing it by a
large copper wire leading up to the engine so as to decrease the resistance of
the circuit it was found that the battery still would not give sufficient spark.
A large quantity of dry cells, such as were used for the engine, had been procured
to insure against delay from lack of batteries, but upon attempting to
get a new set from this reserve supply it was found that they, as well as the set
that was on the machine, had so deteriorated that instead of giving eighteen
amperes on short circuit they would give only three, which was not a sufficient
current to enable the engine to operate. No shop tests on the large engine had
been made since the large aerodrome had been brought down the river, as no
provision had been made for properly supporting the aerodrome in the house-boat
in such a way as to permit the large propellers to whirl around without causing
damage, and, therefore, the batteries which had hitherto proved to be suitable
had not had any special test since they had been brought down the river. As no
batteries suitable for use were on hand, and as none could be procured from a
point nearer than Washington, the test had to be abandoned for the day and
the aerodrome removed to the interior of the boat.</p>

<p>It was at first impossible to account for the rapid deterioration of so large
a number of dry cells, but it was later found that the damp, penetrating fogs
which had been experienced for nearly two months were responsible for it, and
that in order to preserve the batteries in such a climate it was necessary to
place them in metallic boxes which could be nearly, if not quite, hermetically
sealed. New batteries were immediately procured from Washington, and before
again mounting the aerodrome on the launching track provision was made for
testing the engine inside the house-boat.</p>

<div class="caption">PL. 94.
HOISTING WING OF FULL-SIZE AERODROME
<a class="linka" href="#listplates">◊</a>
</div>
</div>

<p>Up to this time the wings had been stored inside the house-boat by suspending
them from the ceiling, but the time required to hoist them to the
upper works on top of the boat, after the main body of the aerodrome had
been placed on the launching car preparatory to making a flight, had added so
greatly to the delay, and consequently to the difficulty of getting the machine
entirely ready for a flight while the weather conditions remained suitable for
a test, that it was decided to build some framework on the upper works and
cover it with canvas so as to provide some boxes in which
the wings could be <span class="xxpn" id="p263">[p263]</span>
stored whenever it seemed probable that a flight would soon be possible. Some
of the difficulties experienced in hoisting these wings from the interior of the
boat to the upper works may be appreciated by an inspection of Plate <a href="#plt094">94</a>, where
one of them is seen just ready to be hoisted from the raft. Only one wing at
a time could be handled on the raft, even when there was no appreciable wind
or roughness of the water, so that in order to hoist all four wings the raft had
to be hauled around from the door at the end of the boat to the side where the
wing was hoisted, and back again four times every time the machine was assembled
preparatory to a flight. The necessity for making occasional tests of
the engine in order to make sure that no trouble would be again experienced
in having proper batteries, etc., for the engine when the machine was again
on the point of being launched also made it imperative to remove the wings
from the interior of the house-boat, as the tremendous blasts of air from the
propellers would certainly have wrecked the wings had they remained in the
boat while the engine was being tested.</p>

<p>After the wings had been stored in the “wing boxes,” thorough tests of
the engine were made, and before there came another day which was at all
suitable for a trial, it was accidentally discovered that the glued joints in the
cross-ribs of the large wings had been softened by the moisture of the fogs
which had penetrated everything, and that the joints had all opened up and
left the ribs in a practically useless condition.</p>

<p>It will be recalled from the description of these cross-ribs, Chapter VI <a href="#tocontents">◊</a>, that
the rib is composed of two channel-shaped strips, the edges of which are glued
together while the strips are bent over a form which causes the ribs to maintain
the curved form desired after the glue has hardened. Recalling these
facts, it will be readily understood that there is at all times a considerable strain
on the glued joints due to the two strips of wood trying to straighten out, and,
therefore, if the glue should at any time become softened sufficiently to allow
one strip to slide along on the other, the joint would open up and the rib would
consequently become straight. When the construction of the hollow ribs was
first contemplated it was realized that although the hollow construction would
enable the ribs to be strong, and at the same time exceedingly light, yet it
would make it imperative that the ribs be covered with a water-proof varnish
in order to prevent the glue from being softened when the aerodrome came down
into the water, as it was expected from the first that it would do at the end of
its flight. Considerable time and attention had, therefore, been given to this
very problem of securing a suitable water-proof varnish, and ribs coated with
the varnish which was finally used had been submerged in water for more than
24 hours in testing this very point, and no softening of the glue could be detected
after this long submergence. It had, therefore, been felt that the ribs
had been given a test which was much more severe than any
conditions which <span class="xxpn" id="p264">[p264]</span>
were likely to be met with, since the aerodrome would, in no case which could
be anticipated, be in the water for so long a period as 24 hours, and no trouble
from this source need be anticipated.</p>

<p>In the present case, however, the moisture of the atmosphere, which had
been heavily laden with fog for several weeks, had penetrated the varnish and
softened the glue, even though the submergence of 24 hours in water had shown
no effect. To construct new ribs for the wings would have required several
weeks, and the delays which had already been experienced had by this time
prolonged the stay down the river so greatly that even under the very best
conditions it seemed hardly possible to complete the tests before the coming
of the equinoxial storms, which would make it necessary to remove the boat
from the middle of the river and place it in a safe harbor. Something, therefore,
had to be done, and that very quickly, so that an immediate test could be
made, or else the tests would have to be delayed until the following season, or
possibly postponed indefinitely on account of the lack of funds.</p>

<p>Owing to the varnish with which the ribs were covered, it was impossible in
repairing them to carry out the first plan which suggested itself of binding the
ribs with a strip of cloth impregnated with glue and wound spirally from end
to end. As the wood was so very thin, it was impossible to bind the two parts
together with wire, and even thin bands of metal driven up on the tapered portion
of the rib were not likely to draw the two strips together without crushing
the wood. What was finally done was to scrape the edges of the two strips
where the joint had opened, thereby removing all the old glue, and after putting
fresh glue on all these edges the two strips were drawn together and bound
with surgeons’ tape, which was found to adhere very firmly even to the varnished
surface.</p>

<p>After repairing the ribs in this manner and readjusting the guy-wires of
their framework so as to make the wing assume the correct form, which had
been slightly altered by the warping and twisting consequent on the opening up
of the ribs, everything was again in readiness for a test in free flight, numerous
tests of the engine having meanwhile been made both with the aerodrome
frame inside of the house-boat and also when mounted on the launching track
above. The weather, which had been unprecedentedly bad all summer, now became
even worse, and although short periods of calm lasting an hour or less
occasionally occurred, there were for several weeks no calm periods long enough
for completing the necessary preparations and making a test, although the time
required for assembling the aerodrome had been greatly shortened by building
the “wing boxes” on the superstructure, and in other ways previously described.
On several occasions when an attempt was made to utilize what appeared
to be a relative calm, the aerodrome was assembled on the launching
apparatus and everything got in readiness except
the actual fastening of the <span class="xxpn" id="p265">[p265]</span>
wings and rudder to it, but in every instance, before the wings could be actually
applied and a flight made, the wind became so strong as to absolutely prohibit
a test. On two occasions when the wings were actually attached, heavy rain
storms suddenly came up and drenched the machine before the wings could be
removed, and on several occasions it was necessary to leave the entire metal
frame and engine of the aerodrome mounted on top of the boat all night, because
the heavy sea which was running made it impossible to utilize the large
raft in returning the frame to the interior of the boat.</p>

<p>Finally, however, after it seemed almost useless to hope for calm weather,
what appeared to be a most propitious day arrived on October 7. The wind
which had been quite high in the early morning gradually quieted until at 10
a. m. it was blowing only about twelve miles per hour and the indications were
that it would quiet down still more. Every energy was concentrated in getting
the aerodrome ready at the earliest possible moment, as previous experience
had shown too clearly that the conditions might be completely reversed in less
than an hour. As the tide and wind caused the boat to swing up the river from
its buoy, and thus made the launching track point down the river, the steam
tug-boat was sent down the river for a distance of a mile or more so that,
should the aerodrome come down into the water without being able to make a
return trip to the house-boat, the tug-boat would be able to reach it quickly
and render assistance to both the writer and the machine should they need it.
At 12.20 p. m. everything was in readiness and what appeared to be the decisive
moment had arrived, when the writer, after starting up the engine and gradually
raising its speed to the maximum, and after taking the last survey of the
whole machine to insure that everything was as it should be, finally gave the
orders to release it.</p>

<p>Although the writer did not have the privilege of seeing it glide down the
track, as his attention was too thoroughly engaged in insuring that he was in
the proper position for reaching immediately any of the control apparatus,
either of the aerodrome or of the engine, yet those who did witness the actual
passage of the machine down the track have said that the sight was most impressive
and majestic. No sign of jar was apparent when the machine was
first released, but with lightning-like rapidity it gathered its speed as it rushed
down the sixty feet of track, the end of which it reached in three seconds, at
which time it had attained a speed of something over thirty-two feet per second.
Just as the machine reached the end of the track the writer felt a sudden
shock, immediately followed by an indescribable sensation of being free in
the air, which had hardly been realized before the important fact was intuitively
felt that the machine was plunging downward at a very sharp angle, and
he instinctively grasped the wheel which controls the Pénaud tail and threw
it to its uppermost extent in an attempt to depress the
rear of the machine and <span class="xxpn" id="p266">[p266]</span>
thereby overcome the sharp angle of descent. Finding that the machine made
no response to this extreme movement of the tail, he immediately realized that
a crash into the water was unavoidable and braced himself for the shock. The
tremendous crash of the front wings being completely demolished as they struck
the water had hardly become apparent before he found himself and the machine
plunging downward through the water. By some instinct he grasped the main
guy-wires which were above his head, and pulling himself through the narrow
space between them freed himself from the machine and swam upward as rapidly
as possible. A few moments after reaching the surface of the water the
uppermost point of the pyramid of the machine was seen to project from the
water and he swam over and sat down on it until a row-boat could be sent to
it from the nearby power-boat.</p>

<p>The first thing that the writer saw after looking around him was a newspaper
reporter, his boatman expending the utmost limit of his power in pushing
his boat ahead to be the first one to arrive.</p>

<p>After giving directions to the workmen regarding the recovery of the machine,
the writer returned to the house-boat to obtain dry clothing, and although
his first inclination was not to make any statement until a complete examination
could be made to determine both the cause of the lack of success and also
the extent of the damage which had been sustained by the machine, yet owing
to the very great pressure brought to bear by the press representatives who
said that unless some statement was given out they would write their own
conclusions as to the cause of the mishap, he finally gave out the following
statement:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smmaj">STATEMENT MADE BY MR. MANLY TO
ASSOCIATED PRESS</span></p>

<p>“It must be understood that the test to-day was entirely an experiment, and
the first of its kind ever made. The experiment was unsuccessful. The balancing,
upon which depends the success of a flight, was based upon the tests
of the models and proved to be incorrect, but only an actual trial of the full-size
machine itself could determine this. My confidence in the future success of
the work is unchanged. I can give you no further information. I shall make a
formal report to Secretary Langley.”</p>

</div>

<p>After recovering the machine the foreman of the workmen (Mr. Reed)
[who together with Mr. McDonald were the only ones on top of the boat when
the launching actually took place], busied himself to discover what had caused
the jerk to the machine at the moment it was released, which had been immediately
followed by the great depression of the front end. After some little
time he discovered that the upright guide at the extreme front of the launching
car (which, as heretofore stated, was slotted to receive a metal lug projecting
from the end of the guy-post, and thus prevent the front
end of the <span class="xxpn" id="p267">[p267]</span> framework
from being twisted by a side wind striking the machine while it was still
on the launching car) had been distorted, the metal cap on it being stretched
out of shape in a way which indicated that the pin of the front guy-post had
hung in the cap, and that the guy-post was not therefore free from this part
of the car when the end of the launching track dropped. The shock which the
writer felt at the moment of launching and which had also been seen by others to
occur was thus conclusively shown to have been due to the falling track,
dragging the front end of the machine down with it. As the machine was travelling
forward and the car had been almost instantly brought to a standstill by
its buffer pistons co-acting with the buffer cylinders at the foot of the track,
this front guy-post had been pulled backwards, and thus not only pulled the
main guy-wires of the wings backwards and thereby depressed the front edge
of the front wings so that they had no angle of inclination, but had also bent
the front end of the metal framework downward,—effects which were discovered
from the later examination of the frame and the guy-post itself. From
the instantaneous photographs which were obtained, indisputable evidence was
obtained that this was what actually occurred. Referring to the photograph,
Plate <a href="#plt095">95</a>, which was taken by Mr. G. H. Powell, Secretary of the Board of Ordnance
and Fortification, and which shows the machine just a few feet in front
of the point where it was actually launched, it will at once be seen that the
front end of the frame is bent downward and that the front guy-post instead of
being parallel with the rear one has been deflected backward at the lower end
through an angle of 30 degrees. Referring further to the photograph, Plate
<a href="#plt096">96</a>, which was taken at the same instant as the one just described, it will be
seen that even this one, which is a view of the machine as it passed almost
directly over Mr. Smillie’s head, most clearly shows the extreme extent to which
the front wings had been distorted, the rear edges of the wings near the frame
having been twisted up until they struck the cross-frame, and the outer ends
being free to twist had been forced up very much higher.</p>

<p>After completing the recovery of the machine and the examination as to
the extent of the injuries it had sustained, and finding unquestionable evidence
that the accident had been caused by the front guy-post hanging in its guide
block on the launching car, the workmen were set to work straightening out and
arranging the various parts, fittings and accessories, and cleaning up the engine
which fortunately had sustained no injury whatever. After a consultation
in Washington with Mr. Langley, who had been unable to be present at
the experiment, both concerning what had already occurred and also what should
be done regarding the future of the work, and in view of the fact that the
statement which the writer had given to the press representatives, immediately
after the accident, had been made before there had been time to make an examination
of the machine itself, it was decided that it would be best
to give to the press <span class="xxpn" id="p268">[p268]</span>
a short statement to correct the earlier one, and Mr. Langley accordingly made
public the following note:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mr. Langley states that he was not an eye witness of the experiment at
Widewater yesterday, having been detained in Washington by business, but that
on the report of Mr. Manly, immediately in charge, he is able to say that the
latter’s first impression that there had been defective balancing was corrected
by a minuter examination, when the clutch, which held the aerodrome on the
launching ways and which should have released it at the instant of the fall, was
found to be injured.</p>

<p>“The machinery was working perfectly and giving every reason to anticipate
a successful flight, when this accident (due wholly to the launching mechanism)
drew the aerodrome abruptly downward at the moment of release and
cast it into the water near the house-boat. The statement that the machine failed
for lack of power to fly was wholly a mistaken one.</p>

<p>“The engine, the frame and all the more important parts were practically
uninjured. The engine is actually in good working order. The damage done was
confined to the slighter portions, like the canvas wings and propellers, and these
can be readily replaced.</p>

<p>“The belief of those charged with the experiment in the ultimate successful
working of the machine is in no way affected by this accident, which is one
of the large chapter of accidents that beset the initial stages of experiments so
novel as the present ones. It is chiefly unfortunate in coming at the end of the
season when outdoor work of this sort is impossible.</p>

<p>“Whether the experiments will be continued this year or not has not yet
been determined.”</p></div>

<p>In view of the many inaccurate accounts published in the daily press at
the time of this experiment, special attention is directed to the fact that even
under the enormous strain to which the aerodrome was subjected, due to its
striking the water at an angle of approximately forty-five degrees and at a
speed certainly not less than forty miles an hour, no bending or distortion of
any kind was found in the frame after it was recovered, except that a slight
depression at the front had been produced by the lower guy-post catching on
the launching car, as previously described. This is very clearly seen in Plate
<a href="#plt097">97</a>, Fig. 1, which shows the aerodrome being hoisted from the water, and in
Plate <a href="#plt097">97</a>, Fig. 2, which shows it just afterwards resting on the raft, the wings,
tail and rudder having been completely demolished by towing it through the
water to the house-boat from the place where it struck the water. This single
distortion, therefore, was in no way a result of the strains experienced by the
frame either while it was in the air or when it struck the water. Some of the
press reports, and, in fact, some of the accounts published in the scientific press,
stated that the aerodrome frame had proved so weak that it broke while the
machine was in the air, and that this was the cause of the accident. Nothing
could be farther from the actual facts than this, for though there were many
things connected with the machine which could not be properly tested until it
was actually in the air, yet the strength of the frame had
been most thoroughly <span class="xxpn" id="p269">[p269]</span>
tested in the shops prior to the trial, and it had been found that with the frame
supported only at the extreme front and rear, no appreciable deflection was
produced upon it by the concentrated weight of four men at the center, even
when they simultaneously jumped up and down on it. That the aerodrome
frame was amply strong was further evidenced by the fact that in the later
trial, hereafter described, no injury was sustained by the frame even when the
machine turned over in mid-air and struck the water flat on its back. In fact,
no point regarding the aerodrome is more certain than that the frame was more
than strong enough for its purpose.</p>

<p>Plates <a href="#plt098">98</a> to <a href="#plt100">100</a> show the aerodrome in the water from the moment after it
arose and the writer, who had extricated himself while it was plunging down
through the water and beat it to the surface, had swum over to it and sat down
on the upper pyramid to await a row-boat, until the machine was taken in tow
by the tug-boat.</p>

<p>As the weather conditions were continually growing worse, owing to the
lateness of the season, it was decided that it would be absolutely impossible
to undertake to keep the house-boat down the river until the aerodrome could be
repaired and another test made, and the writer accordingly returned to Quantico
on the following day, expecting to take the tug-boat from there to the
house-boat and complete arrangements for bringing everything to Washington.
On reaching Quantico, however, it was found that a most violent storm was
raging on the river, and had, in fact, been increasing in violence since the evening
of October 7, immediately following the trial. On account of the storm it
was impossible to reach the house-boat or to get into communication with the
workmen, who had sought refuge at the hotel at Clifton Beach, as the tug-boat
itself was not at the point at which it was expected to be found, and, in fact,
it had not been seen by any of the river people since the morning of October 8,
when it was seen taking the workmen from the boat to Clifton Beach. Two days
later, or October 11, when the storm had subsided and the tug-boat, which had
been blown many miles down the river, was able to return the workmen to the
house-boat, it was found that the storm had made a complete wreck of all the
row-boats, the power-launch, and the large raft. The row-boats had been completely
demolished on the beaches, the launch had been broken from its moorings
to the house-boat and driven ashore some four miles down the river, where
it was found with the deck torn completely off, a large hole stove in it amidships,
and the engine seriously damaged, while the raft had been very seriously
damaged on the beach many miles down the river. After making temporary
repairs to the raft and getting it launched, it was used as a floating dock for
making temporary repairs on the power-launch; both were then returned to
their moorings at the house-boat and everything got in readiness for towing
the house-boat to Washington, and this was finally accomplished
on October 12. <span class="xxpn" id="p270">[p270]</span>
Even while the boat was en route some of the workmen were busily engaged in
the repair of the damaged parts, the others having been sent ahead to Washington
to begin work on the construction of new wings, so that another trial
could be had at the earliest moment that the weather would permit.</p>

<p>One extra pair of wings was on hand, but these had been stored in the
house-boat while it was down the river, and the damp weather, which had caused
such serious damage to the cross-ribs of the wings which were actually used,
had also so seriously affected the ribs of these extra wings that it was necessary
to discard some of them and repair the others. An extra Pénaud tail was
on hand, as well as a steering rudder, and it was estimated that unless some
unforeseen delay occurred the aerodrome would be ready for flight in three
weeks.</p>

<p>After making a careful examination of the places on the river which seemed
most available for an experiment, it was finally decided to make the next test
just off the Potomac Flats, at the junction of the main body of the river and
the Eastern Branch, the traffic on this part of the river, which would have been
more dangerous and troublesome during the summer, being quite light at this
time of the year. By making the experiment at this point it was possible to
leave the house-boat at its dock until the weather seemed suitable and then have
a tug-boat tow it to the exact point, which would be determined by the state of
the wind and the tide.</p>

<p>After more completely examining the condition of the framework of the
machine, and discussing and maturely deliberating on the causes which had led
to the accident of October 7, the writer advised Mr. Langley not to make any
changes either in the machine itself or in the launching apparatus, except to
remove the small lug from the metal rod which projected from the end of the
guy-post, and which by catching in its guide on the launching car had been the
sole cause of the accident. The aerodrome was accordingly repaired so as to
reproduce exactly the conditions which obtained at the time of the previous experiment,
except for this slight change, and it was again ready for trial by
the middle of November. The weather, however, at this time was very variable,
there being at times comparatively quiet periods which lasted for only an
hour or less, which was not sufficient time for procuring a tug-boat and towing
the boat to the proper point, and then assembling the aerodrome and making a
trial. However, after many days waiting, what appeared to be an exceptionally
quiet day occurred on December 8, the wind quieting down by noon to such
an extent that practically a dead calm prevailed. Vigorous search was immediately
instituted for a tug-boat to tow the house-boat to the point selected,
but it was very late in the afternoon before one could be procured, and by the
time the boat arrived at the proper place darkness was
descending and a strong <span class="xxpn" id="p271">[p271]</span>
and exceedingly gusty wind had sprung up, and it seemed almost disastrous
to attempt an experiment.</p>

<p>However, the funds which had been appropriated by the Board of Ordnance
and Fortification had been exhausted nearly two years before, and all the
expense since that time had been met from a special fund of the Smithsonian
Institution. But, owing to the heavy drains which the work had made upon
this fund, Mr. Langley felt unwilling to draw further upon it, and since there
were no other funds available from which to meet the expenses which would
be incurred by postponing the experiments until spring, it was decided that it
was practically a case of “now or never,” and although the river was full of
large blocks of floating ice several inches thick, which added enormously to the
danger involved in the experiment, the writer decided to make the test immediately
so that the long-hoped-for success, which seemed so certain, could be
finally achieved.</p>

<p>After considerable delay, due to the great difficulty of properly assembling
the huge wings in the strong and gusty wind, into which the boat could not be
kept directly pointed, owing both to the strong tide which was running and to
the fact that the wind itself was rapidly varying through as great a range as
ninety degrees, and after many minor delays, due to causes too numerous to
mention, the aerodrome was finally ready for test.</p>

<p>The wind was exceedingly gusty, varying in velocity from twelve to eighteen
miles per hour and shifting its direction most abruptly and disconcertingly,
so that the aerodrome was at one moment pointed directly into it and at
the next moment side gusts striking under the port or starboard wings would
wrench the frame severely, thus tending to twist the whole machine from its
fastenings on the launching car. After starting up the engine and bringing
it to full speed, the writer gave the signal for the machine to be released, and
it started quietly, but at a rapidly accelerated pace, down the launching track.
Exactly what happened, either just before or just as the aerodrome reached
the end of the track, it has been impossible to determine, as all the workmen
and visitors had gone to their stations on the various auxiliary boats, except
the two workmen (Mr. Reed and Mr. McDonald) who had been retained on
top of the boat to assist in the launching. It had grown so dark that the cameras
of Mr. Smillie, the official photographer, were unable to get any impression
when he used them, owing to the extreme rapidity of the shutters with
which they were equipped. Fortunately, one photograph of the machine while
still in the air was secured, which shows the result of what had occurred in the
launching and before any further damage had been caused by its coming down
into the water, but the all-important question as to just what caused the accident
which did occur remains to a certain extent a mystery.
<span class="xxpn" id="p272">[p272]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Reed, the foreman, who was qualified to observe accurately, not only
through his having worked continuously for many years on the machines, but
also from his having witnessed the numerous tests of the models, states that
from his position near the rear end of the launching track he noticed that at a
point about ten feet before the machine reached the end of the track the Pénaud
tail seemed to have dropped at the rear end in some inexplicable way so that
it was dragging against the cross-pieces of the track, and that at the next instant,
when the car reached the end of the track, he saw the machine continue
onward, but the rudder and whole rear portion of the frame and the wings
seemed to be dragging on the launching car. Mr. McDonald, the head machinist,
states that he had his attention so concentrated on the engine, which he
noticed was working perfectly and driving the propellers at a higher rate of
speed than he had ever before seen it do, that he did not see anything happen
until he saw the machine shoot upward in the air, gradually attaining a vertical
position with its bow upward, where it was sustained for a few moments by
the upward thrust of the propellers. After a few moments, however, the strong
wind, which was blowing from twelve to eighteen miles an hour directly ahead
and acting against the wings which were now vertical, drove the machine backwards
towards the house-boat, and he saw it come down into the water on its
back, with the writer gradually righting himself in accordance with the turning
of the machine until he was finally hidden from view by the machine coming
down on top of him. The witnesses on the tug-boats seem not to have been
able to perceive exactly what occurred. All unite in stating that something
seemed to happen to the machine just a few feet before the launching car
reached the end of the track, but what it was they could not say. Everyone
who saw the accident and who was sufficiently familiar with the construction of
the machine to be able intuitively to form an idea as to just what was taking
place was so very close to the machine that when the accident happened everything
seemed to merge into one vision, which was that of the whole rear of
the wings and rudder being completely destroyed as the machine shot upward
at a rapidly increasing angle until it reached the vertical position previously
mentioned.</p>

<p>The writer can only say that from his position in the front end of the machine,
where he was facing forward and where his main attention was directed
towards insuring that the engine was performing at its best, he was unable to
see anything that occurred at the rear of the machine, but that just before the
machine was freed from the launching car he felt an extreme swaying motion
immediately followed by a tremendous jerk which caused the machine to quiver
all over, and almost instantly he found the machine dashing ahead with its bow
rising at a very rapid rate, and that he, therefore, swung the wheel which controls
the Pénaud tail to its extreme downward limit of motion. Finding that <span class="xxpn" id="p273">[p273]</span>
this had absolutely no effect, and that by this time the machine had passed its
vertical position and was beginning to fall backwards, he swung himself around
on his arms, from which he supported himself, so that in striking the water with
the machine on top of him he would strike feet foremost. The next few moments
were for him most intense, for he found himself under the water with the
machine on top of him, and with his cork-lined canvas jacket so caught in the fittings
of the framework that he could not dive downward, while the floor of the
aviator’s car, which was pressing against his head, prevented him from coming
upward. His one thought was that if he was to get out alive he would have
to do so immediately, as the pressure of the water on his lungs was beginning
to make itself seriously felt. Exerting all of the strength he could muster, he
succeeded in ripping the jacket entirely in two and thus freeing himself from
the fastenings which had accidentally held him, he dived under the machine and
swam under the water for some distance until he thought he was out from under
the machine. Upon rising to the surface his head came in contact with a
block of ice, which necessitated another dive to get free of the ice. Upon coming
to the surface of the water he noticed Mr. Hewitt, one of the workmen, just
about to plunge in; before he could call out to indicate he was safe, Mr. Hewitt
had heroically plunged in with the expectation of diving under the machine
where he believed the writer to be entangled. Finding the house-boat was being
rapidly shoved upon him, imperilling the life of both himself and Mr. Hewitt,
besides the safety of the aerodrome, the writer gave orders that the tug-boat
reverse and tow the house-boat away. Then, with the assistance of a row-boat,
he reached the house-boat, where willing hands drew him on board and assisted
him into dryer and warmer clothing.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, it had become quite dark, and when the writer went outside to
see about the aerodrome he found that the men on the tug-boat, in their zeal to
render assistance, had fastened a rope to the rear end of the machine, at the
same time pulling it in the direction in which the front end was pointed, and
through their ignorance had forced it down into the muddy bottom of the river
and broken the main framework completely in two, thus rendering it absolutely
impossible with the facilities at hand to remove it from the water to the interior
of the boat. It was finally necessary to tie the wrecked machine to the
stern of the house-boat and have the boat towed to its dock where the mast and
boom were assembled and the wrecked machine hoisted from the water. This
was finally accomplished about midnight, when the workmen, who had been working
at a fever heat all day, were glad to close up the work for the day, which
had proved so unfortunate.</p>

ATTEMPTED LAUNCHING OF AERODROME, <span class="nowrap">DECEMBER 8, 1903</span>
<a class="linka" href="#listplates">◊</a>
<span class="smaller">
ENLARGEMENT OF PHOTOGRAPH BY THE WASHINGTON STAR</span></div>
</div>

<p>As has already been remarked, darkness had descended to such an extent
that the light was not strong enough to give photographs with the very rapid
shutters with which Mr. Smillie had his cameras equipped,
and that, therefore, <span class="xxpn" id="p274">[p274]</span>
incontrovertible evidence, which the instantaneous photographs had given as to
just what had occurred to the machine in the accident of October 7, was in this
case unfortunately lacking. It was at first thought that no photographs had
been obtained while the machine was actually in the air, but it was later found
that by some rare fortune the photographer for <em class="italic">The Washington Star</em> had secured
a photograph, which, while small, showed very distinctly some decidedly
interesting facts. An enlargement of this photograph is shown in Plate <a href="#plt101">101</a>, by
the kind permission of <em class="italic">The Washington Star</em>. Referring to this photograph,
it will be seen that at the moment it was taken the machine was practically vertical
in the air, and it confirms the testimony of the eye witnesses, and also the
writer’s impression that the machine was maintained in a vertical position for
several moments by the upward thrust of the propellers. It will also be seen
that the Pénaud tail has been completely demolished and is hanging as a limp
roll of cloth, which the strong wind has
deflected backwards towards the house-boat,
the port rear wing has broken its main ribs, both where they are attached
to the main frame and also about midway the length of the wing, the outer end
being partially folded towards the frame. The starboard rear wing has also
broken both of its main ribs at the point where they are joined to the frame,
and they have also broken at a point about one-third their length from the frame,
the outer end being likewise folded towards the frame. By a still more careful
inspection, it will also be seen that the port front wing is apparently uninjured,
while the starboard front wing has broken the middle main rib at a point between
the sixth and seventh cross-ribs, and while it cannot be distinctly seen at
first that the front main rib has also broken at the same point very careful inspection
will show that this is the case, as the sixth and seventh ribs, showing
as faintly darker lines in the photograph, are seen to be displaced, so that they
are together and actually crossing each other. It will furthermore be seen that
both front wings have been pressed upward by the wind until their tips near
the inner ends are in contact with the cross-frame. This could not have happened
unless the front guy-post had given away either by bending or breaking.
The fact that it has given way is further evidenced by a more careful examination
of the extreme front end of the machine, where it will be seen that the bowsprit
and the curved tubes which form the extreme end of the steel frame have
been bent from a straight line with reference to the main frame. This bending
of the bowsprit and the curved tubes could be produced only by the front
guy-post coming in contact with some obstruction on the launching car as the
machine left it. It is known very certainly that the rear end of the machine
came in contact with the launching car, as the car itself shows a very deep gash
in the wooden cross-piece at its center, which was produced by the port-bearing
point at the rear striking it. As this bearing point was elevated five feet
above the cross-piece of the launching car, and
was also six feet six inches to <span class="xxpn" id="p275">[p275]</span>
the rear of the point where the wood is torn, this rear-bearing point must
have travelled downward at an angle of approximately thirty-eight degrees in
order for the bearing point to strike the car at this point. As the lower end of
the rear guy-post was only eighteen inches above the cross-piece of the launching
car, it, of course, would be broken before the bearing point could descend
so much. As has been previously stated, Mr. Reed, who was at the rear of the
launching track, states very positively that the rudder was dragging on the
track at least ten feet before the launching car reached the front end of the
track where the machine was actually launched. There are several ways in
which the rudder could have gotten down on the track, but positive information
is lacking. If it was dragging on the track, as Mr. Reed states (and from
his extended experience and rather acute powers of observation I should place
great credence in his report), the subsequent demolition of the guy-posts succeeded
by the destruction of the rear wings and serious injury of the front
ones is easily explained. If the dropping of the rudder on the track occurred
from the breaking of the upper rudder post, over which the upper control wire
passed, the lower vertical surface would first come in contact with the track,
and the destruction of this part would certainly occasion subsequent destruction
of the horizontal and upper vertical surfaces of the rudder, leaving the
central rib of the rudder still attached to the frame, and upon the machine being
released from the car a few moments later this destroyed rudder would
easily catch in the launching car and pull the aerodrome down on it, and thus
cause the destruction of the guy-posts, wings, and so forth. If the dropping of
the rudder was caused primarily by its main rib breaking loose from its connection
with the frame, the rudder would still be dragged along behind the machine
by the wire cords through which it was operated, and the subsequent
launching of the machine would still give the rudder every chance to catch in
the launching car and drag the machine down on it.</p>

<p>It can therefore be said that, while positive information is lacking, there is
very strong evidence that the accident in the launching was due to the rudder
becoming entangled with the launching track owing to the breakage of some
part of the mechanism by which it was connected to the main frame.</p>

<p>It is of importance to note that the photograph furnishes incontrovertible
evidence that the main frame of the machine was in no way injured, except for
the slight bending of the forward curved extension, and that, therefore, the accident
was in no way due to the weakness of the frame. The main frame was
not even injured by the machine coming down in the water on its back, and the
later damage was entirely caused by the combination of the ignorance of the
tug-boatmen and the darkness in which they were working, when they attempted
to tow it to the rear of the house-boat so that it could be removed
from the water.
<span class="xxpn" id="p276">[p276]</span></p>

<p>On the day following the trial a very careful inspection was made in the
hope of obtaining some more definite information as to just what caused the
accident, but the serious injury to the machine caused by the tug-boatmen breaking
it in the water had so greatly tangled things up that it was impossible to
tell anything about it. The workmen were immediately put to work removing
fittings from the broken wings, rudder, etc., and dismounting the engine, which
was immediately reassembled on its testing frame and found to be absolutely
uninjured. The transverse frame of the machine was comparatively uninjured,
the damage done by the men on the tug-boat being the breaking of the machine
in two at a point just back of the cross-frame, together with the consequent destruction
of the bearing points, “trestle,” and certain fittings by which the
main guy-wires were attached to the main tubes and pyramids.</p>

<p>The situation which now existed was most distressing and disheartening.
Mr. Langley felt that he could not approve of further expenditures from any
Smithsonian fund, and the Board of Ordnance and Fortification of the War Department
having been severely criticised on the floors of Congress for its original
allotment for the work, deemed it inexpedient to incur a possible curtailment
of the funds annually placed at its disposal for general experimental
work through a manifestation of continued interest in the flying machine.</p>

<p>As has already been stated, representatives from the Board of Ordnance
and Fortification of the War Department were present at both tests of the
large aerodrome; on October 7 Major Montgomery M. Macomb and Mr. G. H.
Powell, and on December 7 General W. F. Randolph accompanied by Major
Macomb and Mr. Powell, represented the War Department, and Dr. F. S. Nash,
at that time Contract Surgeon, U. S. A., was officially present at both trials to
render medical assistance should it be needed.</p>

<p>By permission of the War Department, the official report of the tests submitted
by Major Macomb to the Board of Ordnance and Fortification is here
made public:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">R<span class="smmaj">EPORT</span></span></p>

<p>Experiments with working models which were concluded August 8 last having
proved the principles and calculations on which the design of the Langley
aerodrome was based to be correct, the next step was to apply these principles
to the construction of a machine of sufficient size and power to permit the carrying
of a man, who could control the motive power and guide its flight, thus pointing
the way to attaining the final goal of producing a machine capable of such
extensive and precise aerial flight, under normal atmospheric conditions, as to
prove of military or commercial utility.</p>

<p>Mr. C. M. Manly, working under Prof. Langley, had, by the summer of 1903,
succeeded in completing an engine-driven machine which under favorable <span class="xxpn" id="p277">[p277]</span>
atmospheric conditions was expected to carry a man for any time up to half an hour,
and to be capable of having its flight directed and controlled by him.</p>

<p>The supporting surface of the wings was ample, and experiment showed the
engine capable of supplying more than the necessary motive power.</p>

<p>Owing to the necessity of lightness, the weight of the various elements had
to be kept at a minimum, and the factor of safety in construction was therefore
exceedingly small, so that the machine as a whole was delicate and frail and incapable
of sustaining any unusual strain. This defect was to be corrected in
later models by utilizing data gathered in future experiments under varied
conditions.</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable results attained was the production of a gasoline
engine furnishing over fifty continuous horse-power for a weight of one
hundred and twenty pounds.</p>

<p>The aerodrome, as completed and prepared for test, is briefly described by
Prof. Langley as “built of steel, weighing complete about seven hundred and
thirty pounds, supported by one thousand and forty feet of sustaining surface,
having two propellers driven by a gas engine developing continuously over fifty
brake horse-power.”</p>

<p>The appearance of the machine prepared for flight was exceedingly light
and graceful, giving an impression to all observers of being capable of successful
flight.</p>

<p>On October 7 last everything was in readiness, and I witnessed the attempted
trial on that day at Widewater, Va., on the Potomac. The engine
worked well and the machine was launched at about 12.15 p. m. The trial was
unsuccessful because the front guy-post caught in its support on the launching
car and was not released in time to give free flight, as was intended, but on the
contrary, caused the front of the machine to be dragged downward, bending
the guy-post and making the machine plunge into the water about 50 yards in
front of the house-boat. The machine was subsequently recovered and brought
back to the house-boat. The engine was uninjured and the frame only slightly
damaged, but the four wings and rudder were practically destroyed by the first
plunge and subsequent towing back to the house-boat. This accident necessitated
the removal of the house-boat to Washington for the more convenient repair
of damages.</p>

<p>On December 8 last, between 4 and 5 p. m., another attempt at a trial was
made, this time at the junction of the Anacostia with the Potomac, just below
Washington Barracks.</p>

<p>On this occasion General Randolph and myself represented the Board of
Ordnance and Fortification. The launching car was released at 4.45 p. m., being
pointed up the Anacostia towards the Navy Yard. My position was on the
tug Bartholdi about 150 feet from and at right angles to the direction of proposed
flight. The car was set in motion and the propellers revolved rapidly,
the engine working perfectly, but there was something wrong with the launching.
The rear guy-post seemed to drag, bringing the rudder down on the launching
ways, and a crashing, rending sound, followed by the collapse of the rear
wings, showed that the machine had been wrecked in the launching, just how, it
was impossible for me to see. The fact remains that the rear wings and rudder
were wrecked before the machine was free of the ways. Their collapse deprived
the machine of its support in the rear, and it consequently reared up in front
under the action of the motor, assumed a vertical position, and then toppled
over to the rear, falling into the water a few feet in front of the
boat.
<span class="xxpn" id="p278">[p278]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Manly was pulled out of the wreck uninjured and the wrecked machine
was subsequently placed upon the house-boat, and the whole brought back to
Washington.</p>

<p>From what has been said it will be seen that these unfortunate accidents
have prevented any test of the apparatus in free flight, and the claim that an
engine-driven, man-carrying aerodrome has been constructed lacks the proof
which actual flight alone can give.</p>

<p>Having reached the present stage of advancement in its development, it
would seem highly desirable, before laying down the investigation, to obtain
conclusive proof of the possibility of free flight,
not only because there are excellent
reasons to hope for success, but because it marks the end of a definite
step toward the attainment of the final goal.</p>

<p>Just what further procedure is necessary to secure successful flight with
the large aerodrome has not yet been decided upon. Professor Langley is understood
to have this subject under advisement, and will doubtless inform the
Board of his final conclusions as soon as practicable.</p>

<div class="pbinavoid">
<p>In the meantime, to avoid any possible misunderstanding, it should be stated
that even after a successful test of the present great aerodrome, designed to
carry a man, we are still far from the ultimate goal, and it would seem as if
years of constant work and study by experts, together with the expenditure of
thousands of dollars, would still be necessary before we can hope to produce an
apparatus of practical utility on these lines.</p>

<p>The attitude of the Board of Ordnance and Fortification, with reference to
rendering further financial assistance to the work, is clearly shown by the following
extract from the official report of the Board on October 6, 1904, to the
Secretary of War:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center"><span class="smmaj">THE LANGLEY AERODROME</span></p>

<p>Early in the year 1898 a board composed of officers of the Army and Navy
was appointed to examine the models and principles of the aerodrome devised
by Dr. S. P. Langley, Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, and to report
whether or not, in its opinion, a large machine of this design could be built, and,
if so, whether it would be of practical value.</p>

<p>The report of this board was referred to the Board of Ordnance and Fortification
for action, and Doctor Langley was invited to appear before the Board
and further explain the proposed construction.</p>

<p>In view of the great utility of such a device, if a practical success, the
Board, on November 9, 1898, made an allotment of $25,000 for the construction,
development, and test of an aerodrome to be made under the direction of Doctor
Langley, with the understanding that an additional allotment of the same amount
would be made later. On December 18, 1899, the additional allotment of $25,000
was made.</p>

<p>The construction of the machine was delayed by Doctor Langley’s inability
to procure a suitable motor, which he was finally obliged to design. The
aerodrome was completed about July 15, 1903, and preparations for its test
were made at a point in the Potomac River about 40 miles
below Washington. <span class="xxpn" id="p279">[p279]</span></p>

<p>Preliminary arrangements having been completed and tests made of a quarter-size
model, the first attempt at actual flight with the man-carrying aerodrome
was made on October 7, 1903.</p>

<p>On this occasion there were present on behalf of the Board, Major M. M.
Macomb, Artillery Corps, and Mr. G. H. Powell, clerk of the Board.</p>

<p>Major Macomb in his report to the Board stated that—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The trial was unsuccessful because the front guy-post caught in its support
on the launching car and was not released in time to give free flight, as was intended,
but on the contrary, caused the front of the machine to be dragged downward,
bending the guy-post and making the machine plunge into the water
about 50 yards in front of the house-boat.”</p></div>

<p>This accident necessitated the removal of the house-boat to Washington for
the more convenient repair of damages. The repairs having been completed,
on December 8, 1903, another attempt at a trial was made, this time at the
junction of the Anacostia and the Potomac Rivers. General W. F. Randolph
and Major Macomb, members of the Board, and Mr. Powell, were present.
Major Macomb reported as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The launching car was released at 4.45 p.&#160;m.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.
The car was set in motion
and the propellers revolved rapidly, the engine working perfectly, but there was
something wrong with the launching. The rear guy-post seemed to drag, bringing
the rudder down on the launching ways, and a crashing, rending sound, followed
by the collapse of the rear wings, showed that the machine had been
wrecked in the launching, just how, it was impossible for me to see.”</p></div>

<p>March 3, 1904, the Board stated that it was not “prepared to make an
additional allotment at this time for continuing the work,” whereupon Doctor
Langley requested that arrangements be made for a distribution of the aerodrome
material procured jointly from funds allotted by the Board and by the
Smithsonian Institution. Doctor Langley was informed that all of the material
would be left in his possession and available for any future work that he
might be able to carry on in connection with the problem of
mechanical flight.</p></div>

<p>That this refusal of the Board of Ordnance and Fortification to render
further assistance to the work was due to the fear that such action would result
in a curtailment of their appropriation by Congress is clearly shown by
the following extract from the official report of the Board on November 14,
1908, to the Secretary of War:</p>

<p>For a number of years the Board has been interested in the subject of
aerial navigation, and as long ago as 1898 made allotments to carry on experiments
with a machine of the heavier-than-air type, under the direction of the
late Dr. S. P. Langley, Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, who had made
exhaustive experiments in aerodynamics,<a id="fnanchor_48" href="#footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> and who had demonstrated the practicability
of mechanical flight by the successful operation of engine-driven models.</p>

<p>The many problems and mechanical difficulties met with in the development
of the full-size machine have been set forth in the various
published statements<a id="fnanchor_49" href="#footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a>
<span class="xxpn" id="p280">[p280]</span>
of Doctor Langley, and the unsuccessful outcome of the experiments is too well
known to require reiteration. It may be said, however, that at the time of the
trials the Board was of the opinion that the failure of the aerodrome to successfully
operate was in no manner due to the machine itself, but solely to accidents
in the launching apparatus, which caused the wreck of the aerodrome before
it was in free flight.</p>

<p>Doctor Langley considered it desirable to continue the experiments, but the
Board deemed it advisable, largely in view of the adverse opinions expressed
in Congress and elsewhere, to suspend operations in this direction.</p></div>

<p>These adverse opinions expressed in Congress were wholly due to the bitter
criticism by the newspapers, whose hostility was engendered by Mr. Langley’s
refusal to admit their representatives to the shops and house-boat where
the work was in progress. Mr. Langley had at all times tried to make his position
in the matter clear to the newspapers, but, on August 19, 1903, at the
time of one of his visits to the experimental station near Widewater, Va., he
found the newspaper representatives so persistent in their misrepresentations
of his reasons for excluding them that he gave out the following statement,
which was published at that time:</p>

The present experiments being made in mechanical flight
have been carried on partly with funds provided by the Board of Ordnance
and Fortification and partly from private sources, and from a special endowment
of the Smithsonian Institution. The experiments are carried on with the
approval of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution.</p>

<p>The public’s interest in them may lead to an unfounded expectation as to
their immediate results, without an explanation which is here briefly given.</p>

<p>These trials, with some already conducted with steam-driven flying machines,
are believed to be the first in the history of invention where bodies, far
heavier than the air itself, have been sustained in the air for more than a few
seconds by purely mechanical means.</p>

<p>In my previous trials, success has only been reached after initial failures,
which alone have taught the way to it, and I know no reason why the prospective
trials should be an exception.</p>

<p>It is possible, rather than probable, that it may be otherwise now, but judging
them from the light of past experience, it is to be regretted that the enforced
publicity which has been given to these initial experiments, which are
essentially experiments and nothing else, may lead to quite unfounded expectations.</p>

<p>It is the practice of all scientific men, indeed of all prudent men, not to
make public the results of their work till these are certain. This consideration,
and not any desire to withhold from the public matters in which the public is interested,
has dictated the policy thus far pursued here. The fullest publicity,
consistent with the national interest (since these recent experiments have for
their object the development of a machine for war purposes), will be given to
this work when it reaches a stage which warrants publication.</p>

<p>Although it was impossible to immediately find funds for actively continuing
the work, the writer finally, after some delay, persuaded Mr. Langley to
allot a small sum from a limited fund which personal friends had some time
previously placed at his disposal for use in any experiments he might wish to
make. This small sum was used to meet the expense of the workmen who
were kept employed long enough to completely repair the main frame so that,
should further experiments be possible at a later time, there would be no danger
of important parts and fittings having been lost in the meantime, and even
if no further experiments were made the frame would be in such condition that
others could profit from an examination of it, the frame itself embodying the
solution of many important problems which had cost much time and money.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1904, after the repairs to the main frame were well under
way, the writer on his own initiative undertook to see what could be done towards
securing for Mr. Langley’s disposal the small financial assistance necessary
to continue the work; but he found that while a number of men of means
were willing to assist in the development of the aerodrome, provided arrangements
were made for later commercialization, yet none were ready to render
the assistance from a desire to assist in the prosecution of scientific work.
Many years prior to this Mr. Langley had had some very tempting propositions
made to him by certain business men with a view to carrying on the work
in a way that would lead to later commercial development. He had never patented
anything previously in his life, and although many friends had urged that
it was only proper that he should patent whatever of value had been developed
in connection with the aerodromes, he steadfastly refused to do so. He had
given his time and his best labors to the world without hope of remuneration,
and he could not bring himself at his stage of life to consent to capitalize
his scientific work. Success seemed only a step away, and his age was such
that any delay in achieving success increased the probability of his not living
to see it, but he maintained positively and resolutely that, if neither the War
Department nor others felt sufficient interest in the work to provide the small
amount of funds necessary to continue the experiments, and they therefore
could be continued only by his giving in and permitting his work to be capitalized,
he would have to deny himself the hope of living to see the machine
achieve success.</p>

<p>The result is well known to all.</p>

<p>The completely repaired frame of the large machine is now stored in one
of the workshops at the Smithsonian Institution. The large engine, the steam-driven
models Nos. 5 and 6, and the quarter-size model, driven by the three <span class="xxpn" id="p282">[p282]</span>
horse-power gasoline engine, are on exhibition at the U. S. National Museum.
The launching-car and a small amount of materials have also been stored away.
The large house-boat, the construction and maintenance of which proved such
a serious drain on the finances, and the preservation of which would have entailed
the continuance of heavy fixed charges, has been turned over to the War
Department and sold, as has also the power-launch and other paraphernalia
which it seemed useless to preserve.</p>

<p>The writer is firmly convinced that the aerodrome is not only correct in
principle but that it possesses no inherent faults or weaknesses, and that the
success which the work deserves has been frustrated by two most unfortunate
accidents in the launching of the machine. Other plans of launching, several
of which were studied out during the early stages of the work on the large
machine, would have avoided the accident which did occur, but, of course, might
have produced others possibly even more disastrous, but which could be determined
only by actual trial. But even recognizing certain fundamental weaknesses
of the launching mechanism as used, he believes that there is no inherent
reason why the machine should not have been successfully launched, and
that the accidents which proved so disastrous in the two experiments were not
such as should cause a lack of confidence in the final success of the aerodrome.</p>

<p>It might be of interest to add that the writer is now preparing to resume
the work at the earliest opportunity, and that the machine will be used in practically
the form in which it existed at the two previous experiments, though a
slight change will be made permitting experiments over the land rather than
the water. The only thing that prevents an immediate resumption is the pressure
of private business matters.</p>

<p>Before closing this record the writer wishes to acknowledge the very valuable
assistance in the work rendered by Mr. Richard Rathbun, Assistant Secretary
of the Smithsonian Institution, through his moral support and interest
in it at all times, and especially during the trying days of the summer of
1903; by Captain I. N. Lewis, who, while Recorder of the Board of Ordnance
and Fortification from 1898 to 1902, manifested keen interest in the work and
gave it his moral support before the Board; by Professor John M. Manly, who
devoted the whole of the summer of 1903 to it; and by Professor W. G. Manly,
who devoted a large part of the summer of 1903 to assistance in the preparation
for the actual field-trials of the aerodrome.</p>

<p>Mention must also be made of the very loyal and valuable services rendered
by Mr. R. L. Reed, the very efficient foreman of the work during the last
ten years of its progress, to whom much credit is due for his perseverance and
skill in overcoming many of the difficulties which presented themselves, as well
as to Mr. G. D. McDonald, Mr. C. H. Darcey,
Mr. F. Hewitt, Mr. R. S. Newham <span class="xxpn" id="p283">[p283]</span>
and the other employees who labored faithfully for the several years they were
engaged on it.</p>

<p>Since completing the preparation of this Memoir, the writer’s attention has
been called to some very interesting tests made at Issy by M. Louis Blériot with a
machine of the Langley type. These tests confirm in such a practical manner
the conviction that the large aerodrome would have flown successfully had it not
been wrecked in launching that it has seemed well to here quote an interesting
description of them published in the “Bollettino della Società Aeronautica
Italiana, August, 1907,” under the title “Il nuovo aeroplano Blériot,” a translation
of which is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center"><span class="smmaj">THE NEW BLÉRIOT AEROPLANE</span></p>

<p>The Blériot IV in the form of a bird, of which we spoke at length in No. 4 of
the Bulletin of this year, does not appear to give good results, perhaps on account
of its lack of stability, and Blériot instead of trying some modifications which
might remedy such a grave fault, laid it aside and at once began the construction
of a new type, No. V, adopting purely and simply the arrangement of the
American, Langley, which offers a good stability (see Bulletin 11–12, November
to December, 1905, pages 187 and 188).</p>

<p>The experiments, which were commenced a month ago, were first completely
negative, because the 24 HP. motor would not turn the propeller, which was 1.80
m. in diameter and 1.40 m. pitch.</p>

<p>By advice of Captain Ferber, Blériot reduced the pitch of his propeller to
0.90 m., so that the motor could give all its force.</p>

<p>This modification was an important one for his aeroplane. From that
moment every trial marked an advance. On July 12, he made a flight of 30 m.,
and the aviator was able to show that the lateral stability was perfect. On July
15, the trial was made against a wind of 6 miles an hour, but gave good results.
He made a flight of 80 m., showing, however, that the hind part of the aeroplane
was too heavy. In this flight he arose as high as a second story, and on landing
the wheels and one propeller were somewhat damaged.</p>

<p>On July 24, repairs having been completed, a new trial was made. This
time, in order to remedy the defect in the balance, Blériot had moved his seat
forward about 80 cm. The correction was too great, for on that day the aeroplane,
although the hind part arose, was not able to leave the ground. On July
27, after having mounted the seat on wheels as skiffs, Blériot resumed the trials
and made a flight of 120 m., at first moving his seat back and then, after getting
started, bringing it forward. Blériot had not provided this aeroplane with an
elevating rudder, but, following the example of Lilienthal, changed the center of
gravity of the apparatus by moving his own person, and after having established
the proper angle remained immovable on his seat. In order to arise or descend,
the aviator made use of the spark lever, thus varying the number of turns of the
propeller.</p>

<p>During a second trial on the same day, having accidently reached the limit
of the aviation field, Blériot, without allowing himself to be surprised and obliged
to descend, decided to attempt a turn by maneuvering the steering
rudder <span class="xxpn" id="p284">[p284]</span>
and to return again to the center of the field. With marvelous precision, the
aeroplane began to describe a circle of about 200 m. radius, inclining as if on a
banked track. Having finished the flight, he quickly regained his balance still in
the direction of the wind, but on account of a slight movement of the aviator,
the aeroplane fell to such an extent that he was obliged to land. He landed
gently and without shock, rolling on his wheels.</p>

<p>On August 1, he made another flight of 100 m. in
<span class="mixfract">6<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">2</span></span></span>
seconds; and on the 6th,
one of 265 m. with one interruption. While the attention of the pilot was distracted
for a moment, the aeroplane, which was flying at a height of 2 or 3 m.
above the ground, touched the soil with its sustaining wheels at the end of 122 m.
and then immediately arising, covered the remaining 143 m. at a height of 12 m.
Blériot, moving forward too quickly, caused the aeroplane to descend swiftly to
the ground, and the shock broke the axle and the blades of the propeller were
bent. In order to confirm this account, we reproduce what was said in the
“Auto” of August 7, 1907.</p>

<p>“M. Blériot, continuing the trials of his aeroplane yesterday, surpassed the
superb results which he had already obtained. The trial took place at 2 o’clock
in the afternoon on the aviation field of Issy. After a sustained flight of about
122 m. at a height of 2 m., the aeroplane touched the ground, without stopping,
however, and set out again almost immediately at a height of 12 m. and traversed
about 143 m. M. Blériot, who for the time had no other means of balancing but
by moving his body, then moved a little forward to stop the ascent. The aeroplane
plunged forward, and in the fall the propeller was damaged and the axle
broken.</p>

<p>“M. Blériot, whose courage as a sportsman equals his learning as an engineer,
was fortunately uninjured. An inspection of the apparatus showed that one
blade of the propeller was bent, which was sufficient to prevent the maneuver
made by the aviator having its desired effect and contributed to the fall. The
engine will be repaired without difficulty and the trials will be resumed Friday.”</p>

<p>On August 10, he made a flight of 80 m., but the motor was not in perfect
order, so Blériot did not make other trials. He decided, however, to substitute
definitely a 50 HP. motor for the 24 HP. motor with which he made all the experiments
above reported, which were of a character to encourage the most sanguine expectations.</p>

<p>Ferber advised Blériot to adopt an elevating rudder also, because the effect
produced by changing the position of the center of gravity, although efficacious
is very difficult and delicate to control.</p>

<p>The conclusion of an article by Ferber in “Nature” of August 10, is worthy
of note. He says: “Let us remark, in conclusion, how fruitful is the method of
personal trial which we have always advised in preference to any calculation.
This year, with his fourth apparatus, Blériot has not met with any damage to
his aeroplane. He made the trials himself and they quickly led to results, because
each trial gave him an exact idea of what was to be corrected. That is the condition
of success.”</p></div>

<h3 title="Appendix.
Study of the American Buzzard and the “John Crow”.">APPENDIX<br />
STUDY OF THE AMERICAN BUZZARD AND THE “JOHN CROW”
</h3></div>

<p>In the preparation of this Memoir, the writer has deemed it best to generally
omit any mention of plans and ideas which were brought forth in the work, unless
constructions or tests in accordance with them were carried to a sufficient extent
to admit of some definite conclusion regarding them. However, owing to the important
part played by the warping of the supporting surfaces, or the variation
in the angle of auxiliary surfaces, in the methods of preserving the equilibrium
of practically all flying machines of the present day, it may be of interest to here
add a short mention of the direction in which plans along this line were originally
proposed in this work. Mention has already been made of the importance
which Mr. Langley attached to the study of the works of the great master-builder,
Nature, though recognizing at the same time that owing both to the
difference in the forces and methods of construction possible to man, it was not
in general possible for him to produce the best results by attempting to too
closely imitate the methods or plans of Nature.</p>

<p>Mr. Langley considered it not practicable or best to attempt to imitate the
details of construction of the flying mechanism of birds. At the same time, he
strongly believed that much was to be learned from them about the practical
side of the art of balancing, and he therefore spent a great deal of time both in
analyzing the methods practiced by the birds in preserving their equilibrium and
in criticizing his own plans in this direction in the light of what Nature would
seem likely to do if she had to construct a flying creature on such a large scale.
In carrying on his investigations in the art as practiced by the birds, he made a
trip to Jamaica during the early weeks of 1900, in order to study the species of
buzzard which are so numerous and tame there and are known locally as the
“John Crow.” After his return from this trip he wrote the following very
interesting letter to Mr. Robert Ridgway, requesting certain data regarding the
American buzzard, which he wished to compare with some data on the “John
Crow” which he had obtained on this trip:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

 <span class="smcap">R<span class="smmaj">IDGWAY</span></span>:</p>

<p>I have just returned from Jamaica, where among other occupations, I have
been studying the evolutions of the buzzard locally called the “John Crow,” a
soaring bird which is almost as much superior in skill to our buzzard as that is
to a barn-yard fowl in its power of keeping itself in the air without flapping its
wings, in what is very nearly a calm.</p>

<p>I have observed particularly the following points with the Jamaica specimen
(which I can only give, however, approximately), and I should like to have you
give corresponding ones for our Washington buzzard if you can oblige me.
<span class="xxpn" id="p286">[p286]</span></p>

<p>I note here that the measurements were made on a live bird and that it was
impracticable to get the separate weight of the wings except by estimate, but the
two wings may be estimated collectively as
<span class="mixfract">1<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">4</span></span></span>
lbs., the whole weight being
<span class="mixfract">2<span class="fract"><span class="fup">3</span><span class="fdn">4</span></span></span>
lbs.
to 3 lbs.</p>

<p>Approximate values:</p>

<ul><li>Weight of the bird complete, 3 pounds.</li>
<li>Length of bird, 23 inches.</li>
<li>Spread of wings from tip to tip, 5 ft. 5 in.</li>
<li>Complete curtate area of both wings (that is, the area of the shadow of
the bird’s wings when these are fully extended under a vertical sun) is 600
square inches, or nearly 4 sq. ft., consequently each square foot of the bird’s
sustaining surface carries
<span class="fract"><span class="fup">3</span><span class="fdn">4</span></span>
lbs. Diedral angle nearly 150°.</li></ul>

<p>When the bird is soaring in a nearly calm atmosphere, which it inexplicably
does,—soaring I mean nearly in line of the observer’s eyes and coming directly
to of going directly away from him,—it presents nearly the following
appearance:</p>

<div class="xxpn" id="p287">[p287]</div>

<p>I must preface what follows by a little statement of the things which particularly
interest me here and which are not a naturalist’s ordinary concern.</p>

<p>First, I want to know the <em class="italic">CG</em> of the bird when in flight. You will understand
that though there is but one center of gravity (here symbolized as <em class="italic-padr">CG</em>), it
may be considered (1) with reference to its position on the horizontal plan of
the bird with wings extended, when it will always be found somewhere in the
medial vertical plane, passing through the body, and usually nearly at a certain
point with reference to length, the position thus considered being called <em class="italic">CG</em>, or
(2) the position of the same <em class="italic">CG</em> with reference to a vertical plane passing transversely
through the medial line, the position thus considered being called <em class="italic">CG</em><sub>2</sub>.
In the latter case you will understand that the <em class="italic">CG</em> which is that of the whole
body, wings and all, will be carried more or less upward when the wings are
thrown high up, and will be carried temporarily downward when the wings are
at their lowest point of the stroke. It would have a certain position when the
bird was at rest and another position when it was soaring and the wings were
above the body.</p>

<p>The soaring bird is chiefly held upward by the pressure of the air under
each wing, and just as the common center of gravity is a point where all the
efforts of gravity are supposed to be centered, so there is a common center of
pressure, or one point where all the efforts of the upper pressure of the air
may be supposed to be centered, and it will be clear, on very little consideration
that this latter point must be always nearly in a vertical line
through the <em class="italic">CG</em>, and
usually above it. Call it <em class="italic">CP</em>.</p>

<p><em class="italic">CG</em><sub>1</sub> and <em class="italic">CP</em><sub>1</sub> are then, the symbols of <em class="italic">CG</em> and <em class="italic">CP</em> as referred to the horizontal
plane. <em class="italic">CG</em><sub>2</sub> and <em class="italic">CP</em><sub>2</sub> are the symbols for
the corresponding ones when referred
to their position in the vertical plane.</p>

<p>I shall be glad to explain to you, if you are not familiar with it, the simple
method of finding the <em class="italic">CG</em><sub>1</sub> and <em class="italic">CG</em><sub>2</sub>. It consists in bending the wings into just the
position that they would ordinarily occupy above the body in plain soaring flight,
keeping them there by a very light bent stick or wire, then hanging the bird up by
a line attached to the tip of one wing, and see where this line would pass through
the body of the bird, for the <em class="italic">CG</em> will be somewhere in this line. After marking
then, on the body of the bird its position, hang it up a second time by the head or
tail and note again where the new vertical line runs in the new position. There
is but one <em class="italic">CG</em> and but one point in which two straight lines can cross, and that will
be the <em class="italic">CG</em> necessarily. Note with all care just where this is above or below the
center of the body of the bird.</p>

<p>As for the <em class="italic">CP</em> for either wing, that may be nearly found by tracing the wing
on a flat piece of thick paper or cardboard strong enough not to bend much—cutting
out the tracing and balancing it well on the point of a pencil—the point
about which it balances is very near <em class="italic">CP</em><sub>2</sub> or the center of pressure in the vertical
plane. There is such a point of course in each wing, and when they are thrown
up in the actual position that they have in calm soaring flight, we may suppose a
horizontal line drawn between them, and it is the distance from this horizontal
line to <em class="italic">CG</em><sub>2</sub> compared with the area of the wings or with the distance between
their extended tips which we want to know, which gives the vertical distance
which the <em class="italic">CG</em> is below the <em class="italic">CP</em>, the thing we want to know.</p>

<p>It will be very convenient also to have a wing dissected from the body and
the wing itself held in about the soaring curve by a bit of light stick balanced on
a pencil point, which will give the <em class="italic">CG</em> of the wing as distinct from that of the
body. However, the three things I principally want, beside a sketch or <span class="xxpn" id="p288">[p288]</span>
photograph of the bird from about its own level coming directly toward or going
directly away in soaring flight, are these:</p>

<p>Approximate weight of the bird,—and approximate tracing of its extended
wing with the area, so that we can tell the area of the supporting surface relative
to the weight, and finally, the distance between <em class="italic">CP</em><sub>2</sub>, and <em class="italic">CG</em><sub>2</sub>, which is obtainable
by the process which I have explained.</p>

<p>I am afraid that what I have just been describing at such length may have a
certain obscurity to you, but if you will give me an opportunity, I shall be pleased
to illustrate it with the actual experiment when the bird is hung up by a string,
and you will see that it is in reality simple.</p>

<p>Referring to the sketches on page 3 of this communication, <em class="italic">a</em> and <em class="italic">b</em> correspond
to the centers of pressure on either wing where the upward pressure of the
air distributed over each wing may be supposed to be gathered in a single point.
This, as I have said, is called the center of pressure with reference to the vertical
flight, and its symbol is <em class="italic">CP</em><sub>2</sub>, while the horizontal dotted line between them represents
the level of <em class="italic">CP</em><sub>2</sub>, from the best estimate that I could make when the wings
are in their natural position of soaring. It is evident that this line passed far
above the body of the vulture, and if (the corresponding symbol for the height
of the center of gravity being <em class="italic">CG</em><sub>2</sub>), the <em class="italic">CG</em><sub>2</sub>, of the entire bird be taken, it will
be found to lie nearly in the point <em class="italic">c</em>. Where <em class="italic">c</em> is in the present case, I could not
determine exactly in my hasty examinations in the live bird, but I assume that it
is about
<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">2</span></span>
way between the central horizontal axial line of the bird’s body and
the upper portion. I repeat that it is important to me to know what the vertical
distance is between <em class="italic">CP</em><sub>2</sub> and <em class="italic">CG</em><sub>2</sub> in each specimen of soaring bird. I may observe
in illustration that in the common sea-gull, it is nearly as shown in the faint
sketch; that is to say, that the corresponding line <em class="italic">a</em>
<em class="italic">b</em> in the soaring gull passes
distinctly through the upper part of the body, and the distance down to the <em class="italic">CG</em><sub>2</sub> of
the whole in the gull is almost nil, while in the buzzard it is very considerable
as shown by the corresponding distance in the “John Crow.”</p>

<p>Now, what I want to get from you is the corresponding figures for an average
specimen of our Washington buzzard. If you will kindly have one killed and
weighed while fresh, and before the rigor-mortis has set in, first noting the position
of its wings when soaring in a calm, and (if possible) when coming toward
you or going away in about a horizontal plane with your eye, in which position
the wings will be elevated and bent somewhat as in the case of the above sketch
of the “John Crow”; if you will kindly do this, so as to give me corresponding
facts with reference to the buzzard, namely weight, area of extended wing surface,
distance between tips as bent up in ordinary flight, distance between <em class="italic">extended</em>
tips, <em class="italic">the quantity</em>
<em class="italic">CP</em><sub>2</sub>−<em class="italic">CG</em><sub>2</sub>, and also will make such a tracing of the buzzard’s
wing as Mr. Manly will show you of the “John Crow’s,” I shall be
obliged.</p>

<p>My impression is that the buzzard is a considerably heavier bird than the
“John Crow,” without, however, very much greater spread of wing. I may
observe that when the wings of the Jamaica bird were spread out, they were
spread quite to their utmost extent, and the distance between the tips of the
terminal feathers was much greater than when in flight. I wish you would
kindly also add the scientific name of the “John Crow,” with any particulars
that you would think of interest.</p>

<p>If there be any special expenses incurred in the preparation of this memorandum,
including the time of a photographer, I will direct them to be paid
from the Smithsonian fund.

<p>If you could get Mr. Holmes (who made most of the sketches and all of the
photographs of the “John Crow”), to try and do something like this for your
buzzard, especially getting such a photograph of it <em class="italic">in flight</em>, as will give the position
of its center of gravity relative to the center of pressure on the wings, it
would add very greatly to the value of your memoranda, and I think Mr. Holmes
takes so full and intelligent an interest in the subject, that he might be pleased
to give his help.</p>

<p>1. <em class="italic">Weight</em>.—1850 grammes.</p></div>

<p>2. <em class="italic">Area of outstretched wings</em>.—641 square inches. (Computed from three
sheets of tracings, <em class="italic">A</em><sub>1</sub> and <em class="italic">A</em><sub>2</sub> comprising the entire area of both wings; <em class="italic">B</em>, a
single wing.)</p>

<p><em class="italic">Note</em>.—As the bird was in process of moult, one of the large wing quills, as
shown by the tracings and compo-board patterns, is but partially developed,
thus slightly modifying the results obtained. Its length, if full grown, would be
nearly the same as that of the quill just above it.</p>

<p>3. <em class="italic">Distance between the tips of these wings</em>.—5 feet, 8.7 inches.</p>

<p>4. <em class="italic">Distance between the tips of the same wings when the bird is in horizontal
soaring flight</em>.—Estimating the dihedral angle of the wings to be 150°, and
elevating the wings so as to make this angle, the distance between their tips <span class="xxpn" id="p290">[p290]</span>
measures 5 feet, 5.7 inches, or 3 inches less than when fully extended in the horizontal
plane.</p>

<p>5. <em class="italic">The position of the center of pressure of the wing</em>.—This is indicated on
two compo-board patterns, <em class="italic">C</em> and <em class="italic">D</em>. <em class="italic">C</em> was made from a fully extended wing,
while <em class="italic">D</em> was made from the wing in the soaring position. The centers of pressure
of the wings are about 2 feet, 0.5 inches apart, or 1 foot, 0.25 inches from the
central point of the bird’s body.</p>

<p>6. <em class="italic">The position of the center of gravity of the soaring bird</em>.—(Length of
buzzard, 26 inches.) The center of gravity of the soaring buzzard in the horizontal
plane, CG<sub>1</sub>, was found to lie
<span class="mixfract">9<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">2</span></span></span>
inches behind the tip of the beak and
<span class="mixfract">16<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">2</span></span></span>
inches in front of the tip of the tail.</p>

<p>The center of gravity of the soaring bird in the vertical plane, <em class="italic">CG</em><sub>2</sub>, was
found to lie 2.8 inches above the ventral point of the body and 1.6 inches below
the dorsal point, the depth of the bird’s body at <em class="italic">CG</em><sub>1</sub>, being 4.4 inches.</p>

<p>In determining the center of gravity, the bird was frozen in the soaring
position, its wings making a dihedral angle of 150°. It was then hung up, first
horizontally and then vertically, and balanced till the line from which it was suspended
coincided with a plumb-line placed in front of it; the measurements were
then made.</p>

<p>The bird was afterwards, and while still frozen, hung up in the same way
in Mr. Smillie’s photographic room, and exposures made by him in both positions.
These photographs, <em class="italic">E</em><sub>1</sub> and <em class="italic">F</em><sub>1</sub> were enlarged to natural size, and measurements
made on the enlargements yielded, as nearly as could be determined,
the same results as when taken directly upon the bird.</p>

<p>As determined by measurements upon the buzzard in soaring position, the
center of gravity was found to be 2.65 inches below the center of pressure (estimating
the center of pressure to be at the bend of the wing); or, employing the
compo-board pattern in a corresponding position, the distance was seen to be a
small fraction of an inch less.</p>

<p>7. <em class="italic">The position of the root of the wing</em>.—This is indicated on the tracing A<sub>1</sub>.</p>

<p><em class="italic">a.</em> (Depth of the body on a vertical line with root, 3.5 inches.) The root lies
1.6 inches below dorsal line, 1.9 inches above ventral line.</p>

<p><em class="italic">b.</em> (Length of body, 26 inches.) The root lies 7.6 inches behind tip of beak,
18.4 inches in front of tip of tail.</p>

<p>8. <em class="italic">The dihedral angle between the wings</em>.—The photographs taken previously
were not sufficiently large or distinct to enable us to determine this with
exactness. It was estimated, however, as 150°, and experiments were made on
this basis.</p>

<p>9. <em class="italic">The center of gravity of the dissected wing</em>.—This was found, <em class="italic">first</em>, for
the wing having all the muscles, up to the ball and socket joint, intact. One of
the wings was frozen in the soaring position and its center of gravity found by
balancing on a point. Its position was marked by a wire thrust through
the wing at this place, and the wing (<em class="italic-padr">H</em>) is preserved in formalin. This position
is also marked on a special tracing, <em class="italic">I</em>. It lies 6 inches from the base of the
humerus bone (root of wing). <em class="italic">Secondly</em>, it was found for the wing denuded of
all muscle. Its position was marked on the other wing of the bird, which is preserved
dry, spread in the soaring position. It lies
<span class="mixfract">9<span class="fract"><span class="fup">3</span><span class="fdn">4</span></span></span>
inches from the base of the
humerus.
<span class="xxpn" id="p291">[p291]</span></p>

<p>10. <em class="italic">The weight of the dissected wing</em>.—</p>

<p><em class="italic">a.</em> With all muscle up to the ball and socket joint intact, 325 grammes.</p>

<p><em class="italic">b.</em> With all muscle removed, 190 grammes.</p>

<p>Weight of muscle, therefore, 135 grammes.</p>

<p><em class="italic">The position of the root of the tail</em>.—</p>

<p><em class="italic">a.</em> In the horizontal plane, 11.8 inches in front of the tip of the longest tail
feather; 14.2 inches behind tip of beak.</p>

<p><em class="italic">b.</em> In the vertical plane: (depth of body from ventral point below root of tail
to a point directly above, which is on a level with the highest point of the back,
2.5 inches.) 1.5 inches above ventral point, 1 inch below dorsal point.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Weight of tail</em>.—With muscle, 40 grammes; <em class="italic">without</em> muscle, 30 grammes.
Weight of muscle, therefore, 10 grammes.</p>

<p>The feats of airmanship performed by the “John Crow” seemed to greatly
impress Mr. Langley and shortly after this trip he wrote the following letter to
the writer:</p>

<span class="smcap">M<span class="smmaj">R.</span></span>
<span class="smcap">M<span class="smmaj">ANLY</span></span>:</p>

<p>I am reminded of the consequence that I have, in connection with Mr.
Chanute and perhaps Mr. Huffaker, attached in the past to the possibility of
directing the bird, and consequently the flying machine, by the mere inflection of
the wing, that is, by changing its angle; and you recall to me that Mr. Huffaker
at one time proposed to arrange a wing, with some provision of a spring, which
should enable it to change its angle automatically.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.</p></div>

<p>I have been noting this ability to guide by the slight inflection of the wing,
in my studies of the Jamaica buzzard, and am ready to say that I think, while
the quarter-sized working model of the great aerodrome is building, it will be
worth while to make some arrangement of the frame or wing-holder which will
make it possible to test this idea. I will endeavor to work out something of the
kind more in detail myself, but whatever it is, it will apparently involve the
ability of the wing to rotate about a line passing nearly through it lengthwise,
and an allowance for this; if not in the wing itself, then in the wing-holder;
will need to be made while the present model is under construction.</p>

<div class="pbinavoid">
<p>I will request you to especially look out for this, as far as you can on these
indications.</p>

<p>The instructions and suggestions contained in this letter and in many conferences
on the subject were never carried out by the writer, on account of the
extreme pressure of the work already on him which had for its object, not the
production of a flying machine which would embody all of the control which we
wished it to have, but which would be burdened only with such devices and
arrangements as would enable it to transport a human being, and thus demonstrate
the practicability of human flight.</p>

<h4>SECRETARY LANGLEY’S INSTRUCTIONS TO ASSISTANTS</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">S<span class="smmaj">MITHSONIAN</span></span>
<span class="smcap">I<span class="smmaj">NSTITUTION</span></span>, <span class="smcap">W<span class="smmaj">ASHINGTON</span></span>, D. C.,
November 30, 1895.</p>

<p class="first"><span class="smcap">D<span class="smmaj">EAR</span></span>
<span class="smcap">S<span class="smmaj">IR</span></span>:</p>

<p>The following instructions are to replace those of May 13, 1895:</p>

<p>1. The <em class="italic">minimum</em> fraction of its own “flying weight” (that is, weight complete
with initial water and fuel), which the aerodrome shall lift on the pendulum,
is 50 percent,<a id="fnanchor_50" href="#footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a>
under such engine power as can certainly be gotten up in the
field and maintained during forty seconds from the time the aerodrome is let go.</p>

<p>The blast, the pumps, and all other essential parts must, in other words, be
in such a condition that steam enough for this lifting over 50 per cent of weight
can be gotten up readily and surely in the field and in a time which will still
leave at least forty seconds’ supply.</p>

<p>2. The <em class="italic">minimum</em> relation of supporting area to weight in any aerodrome
constructed hereafter, is to be two feet to the
pound,<a href="#footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a>
and the minimum of power
at the rate of one steadily-maintained horse power<a href="#footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a>
at the brake under ordinary
conditions, to not over twenty-two pounds (ten kilos) of flying weight. In
absence of a brake determination horse power may be taken—</p>

<div class="equationbox">
<p>H. P.&#160;=</p>
<span class="nowrap"><span class="fract"><span class="fup">revs. per min. at rest × pitch × diameter
 (in ft.) × thrust (in lbs.)</span><span class="fdn">33,000</span></span>.</span>
</div>

<p class="continue">These rules do not apply to No. 5, but
they do to No. 6, which is to be built over,
if necessary, to meet them.</p>

<p>3. In balancing an aerodrome, unless otherwise instructed, set wings at a
root angle of either 10°, 7°, or 5°, after being certain from previous inversion and
sanding, that the tip angle in motion will not differ from this root angle as much
as 5°.</p>

<p>The object in balancing any aerodrome with a single pair of wings is to be
able to bring the <em class="italic">c g</em><sub>2</sub> under their <em class="italic">c p</em><sub>2</sub> without any reference to the tail, which
supports nothing, unless specially ordered. But as this condition cannot now be
obtained in Nos. 5 and 6, these at any rate, and perhaps future aerodromes, are
to carry a second pair of wings. When this second pair of wings is of nearly
equal size with the first it is to be assumed in preliminary adjustments for
weight and center of pressure, that the second pair has two-thirds the lifting
efficiency per unit area of the first.</p>

<p>Calling the whole distance from the mean center of pressure of the wings
to the center of gravity <em class="italic">M</em>. <em class="italic">M</em> is to have a definite relation
to the breadth of <span class="xxpn" id="p295">[p295]</span>
wings from tip to tip (<em class="italic-padr">b</em>) and total fore and aft length (1), which is provisionally
fixed at
<span class="nowrap">M&#160;=<span class="fract"><span class="fup">√(bl)</span><span class="fdn">8</span></span>,</span>
and the line of thrust is to be not over one-fourth the way
from
<span class="nowrap"><em class="italic">c p</em><sub>2</sub></span>
to
<span class="nowrap"><em class="italic">c g</em><sub>2</sub>.</span></p>

<p>Generally speaking the front pair of wings will be fixed in position and the
adjustment for balancing made by moving the rear pair.</p>

<p>The individual weights of all parts checked by lump weighing are to be given
by the caretaker (Mr. Huffaker), under the general scheme shown in the note.
The work on the aerodromes being divided into two classes, viz.: metal work and
all which is not metal, the two in charge of this work (Mr. Reed and Mr. Maltby)
are severally responsible for knowing the weight in grammes of any of the parts
they have put into their work, giving these weights to Mr. Huffaker, together
with any data for filling out the annexed tables,<a id="fnanchor_51" href="#footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> on his request.</p>

<p>Until further orders, Mr. Huffaker is charged with the responsibility of
seeing that these conditions are met before any aerodrome is boxed, and will keep
the record of weights of the aerodromes and their principal parts as already completed,
in a book, to be preserved in your keeping, which will also be arranged to
show with signed <em class="italic">photographs</em> and descriptions, and with sketches where needed,
the condition and weight (as far as constructed) of every aerodrome, and of any
new construction of any part, on the first of each month.</p>

<p>Particular attention is directed to the preceding paragraph, and to the need
that evidence of a definite character is to be obtained and preserved of everything
already done, and being done.</p>

<p>Without special orders to the contrary, you will not authorize the boxing of
any aerodrome which does not, to your knowledge, meet these conditions.</p>

<p>Each aerodrome is to have the following parts in duplicate or in triplicate:</p>

<div class="equationbox">
<ul class="inlineblk"><li>2 pairs wings;</li>
<li>2 pairs tails;</li>
<li>2 pairs light silk covered rudders;</li>
<li>3 pairs wheels;</li>
</ul></div>

<p class="continue">with any other parts in duplicate or triplicate, which experience has shown to be
necessary.</p>

<p>Mr. Reed will not box any aerodrome till a certificate from Mr. Huffaker can
be put on the inside cover, with the list of contents, showing what the conditions
are as to weight, wing area, power, etc., and the person in the field charged with
the duty of launching the aerodrome (at present Mr. Reed), is authorized not to
let it go unless he is satisfied that it has a full forty
seconds’ supply of steam.
<span class="xxpn" id="p296">[p296]</span></p>

<p>I am satisfied that a great deal of time is lost in putting the aerodrome together
for flight, owing to the absence of any preliminary drill in doing this.
Before it goes into the field the whole is to be completely boxed, and then taken
out from the box and set up on the clutch, and steam gotten up for flight. All
this is to be done in the shop before the final boxing, and provision is to be made
so that no wiring or adjusting of parts is to be done in the field which can possibly
be avoided by forethought in the shop. The tail-piece, for instance, is to be
bushed with brass, so that it will always come into the same place, and make a
tight fit, in spite of wetting or shrinking, in the steel tube, where it is to go into a
guide-way with a bayonet spring, or a like contrivance for setting it at once
securely into position.</p>

<div class="pbinavoid">
<p>The mean positions of the wings and tail are to be laid out in some way
permanently on the mid-rod, but every guy-rod or adjustable piece is to be arranged
so as to fit at once securely and permanently in its position without wiring
or like slow process.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="footnote_37" href="#fnanchor_37" class="fnlabel">[37]</a>
“The Flying Machine” <em class="italic">McClure’s Magazine</em>, June, 1897.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

One noted astronomer and mathematician re-affirmed this
opinion as late as 1900 and even stated that man could not hope to
construct a flying machine capable of sustaining a weight as great
as our largest birds, knowing that even at that time the model
Aerodromes Nos. 5 and 6 had already done more than this.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="footnote_39" href="#fnanchor_39" class="fnlabel">[39]</a>
These wings are described in Chapter VI, pp.
<a href="#p191">191</a>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

See “Experiments in Aerodynamics.” It will be recalled
that in the experiments with the “plane-dropper” there was a greatly
reduced lifting power with superposed planes when their distance
apart was one-half the width the planes, unless a speed of about 42.5
feet a second was obtained. In the above tests with the superposed
wings, the speed was only from twenty to twenty-two feet a second at
the time of launching, and as the distance between the surfaces was
only one-half as great as their width, it is not surprising that the
lifting power should not be as great as with the “single-tier” wings.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="footnote_41" href="#fnanchor_41" class="fnlabel">[41]</a>
In fact the setting of the tail at a negative angle
and fastening it to the frame by an elastic or spring connection
was only begun in 1896, and while it proved to be the key to the
solution of the problem of automatic longitudinal stability, yet it
was not at that time so recognized, although the first real test of
the aerodromes after the elastic connection and negative angle of the
tail were adopted resulted in the epoch-making flight of No. 5 on May
6. By comparing the angle of the tail on No. 5 in Plate <a href="#plt027a">27A</a>, Part I,
with the angle of the tail on No. 6 in Plate <a href="#plt027b">27B</a>, Part I, it will be
seen that while the first had an angle of much less than 5 degrees,
the latter had an angle of about 15 degrees. But the wooden springs
changed so that it was not accurately known what the angle really was
at the time at either flight in 1896.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="footnote_42" href="#fnanchor_42" class="fnlabel">[42]</a>
The drawings, Plate <a href="#plt055">55</a>, which illustrate many of the
fittings used on the frame, show the guy-wires as attached by means
of loops twisted in their ends, these drawings having been made
before the final plan of attaching the wires had been devised.</p></div>

The weight was afterwards increased to 850 pounds due to
repairing the wings and adding more sparking batteries.</p></div>

All these minimum permissible conditions are connected
by the tacit assumption that the supporting area is not greatly
over 2 ft. to the pound of weight. If for instance the weight were
increased by larger wings or more wings, furnishing a much greater
supporting area per pound, these conditions would not necessarily
apply.</p></div>

T<span class="smmaj">RANSCRIBER'S</span> N<span class="smmaj">OTE</span>

<p>Original spelling and grammar have been generally retained, with
some exceptions noted below.</p>

<p>Original printed page numbers are shown in the right margin
like "p052".</p>

<p>Original small capitals <span class="smcap">L<span
class="smmaj">OOK</span></span> <span class="smmaj">LIKE</span>
<span class="smmaj">THIS</span>.</p>

<p>Footnotes have been renumbered and
moved from the ends of pages to the ends of the appropriate
sections, which are: Advertisement (page iii);
Part I; and Part II, up to just ahead of the Data Sheets&#8212;which
have their own footnotes, which were neither moved nor renumbered.</p>

<p>Illustrations are moved from inside paragraphs to between
paragraphs. The symbol "<span class="hhnoshowexample">lgr</span>", in
a caption to an illustration, links to a larger image&#8212;these are
available only in the html edition. The transcriber created the cover image
by editing the title page image, and
hereby assigns it to the public domain.</p>

<p>Pages <a href="#p016">16</a>–<a href="#p018">18</a>. Page 16 ended
after "with another one, No. 31, also shown" (i.e. in the middle of
a sentence). This was followed by Plates <a href="#plt001">1</a>–<a href="#plt004">4</a>, &#38; then by page 17,
which contained two data tables, &#38; then page 18, which continued
the original paragraph. The transcriber has closed the paragraph, and
moved the Plates and tables to follow it.</p>

<p>Pages <a href="#p031">31</a>–<a href="#p032">32</a>. The footnote
on page 31 said only "See footnote on page 32." The footnote on
page 32 had no anchor in the text. Therefore, to simplify, the
page 31 footnote has been eliminated, and its anchor is linked
directly to the page 32 footnote. Pages <a href="#p046">46</a>–<a
href="#p047">47</a>. The footnote on page 47 had no anchor in the
text. However, the footnote on page 46 said only "See Footnote page
47". Therefore, the footnote anchor on page 46 has been linked
directly to the footnote on page 47, eliminating the page 46
footnote.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#p063">63</a>. The large table was split into two tables, repeating the
first column in each part.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#p140">140</a>. The paragraph for June 23 originally ended "dotted line in
Plate". The transcriber has inserted " 34.", as a guess.</p>

<p>Pages <a href="#p190">190</a>–<a href="#p192">192</a>. The wide tables were split into two, repeating the
first column in each part.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#p193">193</a>. The wide tables were transposed, row for column.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#p201">201</a>. The wide table was split into two.</p>

<p>Pages <a href="#p297">297</a>–<a href="#p308">308</a>, Data
Sheets. Remarks originally situated in the tables are appended
below each Data Sheet. The units of measurement were originally
spelled out—<em class="italic">m.</em>&#160;=
<em class="italic-padr">Metres</em>; <em class="italic">ft.</em>&#160;=
<em class="italic-padr">Feet</em>; <em class="italic">gr.</em>&#160;=
<em class="italic-padr">Grammes</em>; and <em class="italic">lbs.</em>&#160;=
<em class="italic">Pounds</em>. In the
footnotes to the Data Sheets, in the phrases "curved wings 2-5 the
way", and "rear wings have 2-3 of the efficiency", the hyphen seems
to mean division, like "&#47;". This usage occurs also in the caption
to Plate <a href="#plt085">85</a>, in "SCALE 1 1-16 INCH TO STATUTE MILE".</p>

<p>Page <a href="#p299">299</a>. Item 41, "7 75" changed to "7.75".</p>

<p><a href="#p309">INDEX</a>. The original index was structured in a way not suitable for
this ebook. The white space on the printed page substituted for words
not repeated. Thus, under "Balancing of aerodrome, … ", were
indented entries for "engine", "wings and rudder", &#x26;c. This spacing
has been rendered herein as a horizontal bar "―", one for each word
to be understood as repeated. So in this case, two bars, meaning
"Balancing of". Moreover, page numbers referenced by index entries
were right-justified and preceded by dotted leaders. Herein, the
leaders have been suggested by horizontal ellipsis "…".</p>

<p>Estimating from Internet
Archive's stated scanning rate of 400 ppi, the pages were about 6.2
by 9.2 inches. Body text was printed in 9 point type, with 3 point
leading, and footnotes were printed in 5.4 point type.</p>
